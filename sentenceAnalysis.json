and in this workhouse was born; on\r\na day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\r\nit can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\r\nthe business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\r\nprefixed to the head of this chapter.", "Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a\r\nworkhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance\r\nthat can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this\r\nparticular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could\r\nby possibility have occurred.", "The fact is, that there was considerable\r\ndifficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\r\nrespiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\r\nnecessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a\r\nlittle flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and\r\nthe next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.", "Now,\r\nif, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful\r\ngrandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of\r\nprofound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been\r\nkilled in no time.", "There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old\r\nwoman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;\r\nand a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and\r\nNature fought out the point between them.", "The result was, that, after\r\na few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise\r\nto the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\r\nimposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\r\nreasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\r\npossessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\r\nspace of time than three minutes and a quarter.", "As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his\r\nlungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron\r\nbedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly\r\nfrom the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,\r\n'Let me see the child, and die.'", "What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\r\nwas!", "Oliver cried lustily.", "CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\r\n\r\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\r\ncourse of treachery and deception.", "The parish\r\nauthorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\r\nthere was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a\r\nsituation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\r\nwhich he stood in need.", "Upon this, the parish authorities\r\nmagnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,'\r\nor, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse\r\nsome three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\r\nagainst the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the\r\ninconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental\r\nsuperintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and\r\nfor the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.", "Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the\r\nfemale to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\r\nsimilar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\r\nthe very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\r\npossible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\r\nin eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\r\nand cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\r\naccident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\r\nusually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\r\nit had never known in this.", "Oliver Twist's ninth birthday\r\nfound him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\r\ndecidedly small in circumference.", "But nature or inheritance had\r\nimplanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast.", "'(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em\r\ndirectly.)--My heart alive!", "'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\r\nyear old to-day.'", "He finished the\r\ngin-and-water, and added, 'Oliver being now too old to remain here, the\r\nboard have determined to have him back into the house.", "Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of\r\ndirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed\r\noff in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.", "'Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann.", "Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,\r\nand the cocked hat on the table.", "'Will you go along with me, Oliver?'", "Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great\r\nreadiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had\r\ngot behind the beadle's chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a\r\nfurious countenance.", "inquired poor Oliver.", "Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you\r\nwant to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.", "Mrs. Mann gave\r\nhim a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a\r\npiece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got\r\nto the workhouse.", "With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\r\nbrown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.\r\nBumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never\r\nlighted the gloom of his infant years.", "Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping\r\nhis gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every\r\nquarter of a mile whether they were 'nearly there.'", "Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an\r\nhour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of\r\nbread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old\r\nwoman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him\r\nthat the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.", "Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,\r\nOliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite\r\ncertain whether he ought to laugh or cry.", "Oliver brushed away two or three\r\ntears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the\r\ntable, fortunately bowed to that.", "Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him\r\ntremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him\r\ncry.", "inquired poor Oliver.", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.", "It would have been very like a Christian, and a\r\nmarvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people\r\nwho fed and took care of _him_.", "For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process\r\nof picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and\r\nwas then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he\r\nsobbed himself to sleep.", "Poor Oliver!", "For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\r\nin full operation.", "Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\r\nslow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\r\nwild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn't\r\nbeen used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\r\ncook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\r\nbasin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\r\neat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\r\ntender age.", "A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\r\nmaster after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\r\nOliver Twist.", "The gruel disappeared; the boys\r\nwhispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors\r\nnudged him.", "'Please, sir,' replied Oliver, 'I want some more.'", "The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him\r\nin his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.", "Oliver Twist has asked for\r\nmore!'", "Oliver was ordered into instant confinement;\r\nand a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering\r\na reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\r\nhands of the parish.", "In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\r\noffered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,\r\nbusiness, or calling.", "As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\r\ngentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this\r\nnarrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint\r\njust yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination\r\nor no.", "CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\r\nHAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n\r\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\r\nasking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\r\nsolitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\r\nthe board.", "There was a still greater\r\nobstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness.", "Let it not be supposed by the enemies of 'the system,' that, during the\r\nperiod of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of\r\nexercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious\r\nconsolation.", "And so far from being denied the\r\nadvantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same\r\napartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen\r\nto, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys,\r\ncontaining a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the\r\nboard, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented,\r\nand obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver\r\nTwist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the\r\nexclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an\r\narticle direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.", "It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious\r\nand comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way\r\ndown the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means\r\nof paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become\r\nrather pressing.", "Having witnessed the little dispute\r\nbetween Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\r\nperson came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\r\nwas exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.", "Mr. Gamfield\r\nhaving lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,\r\nand another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his\r\nabsence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room\r\nwhere Oliver had first seen him.", "Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver\r\nTwist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for\r\nsignature and approval, that very afternoon.", "In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive\r\nastonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself\r\ninto a clean shirt.", "At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:\r\nthinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill\r\nhim for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten\r\nhim up in that way.", "'Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.", "'You're a going to\r\nbe made a 'prentice of, Oliver.'", "'Yes, Oliver,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'The kind and blessed gentleman which\r\nis so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are\r\na going to 'prentice' you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of\r\nyou: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three\r\npound ten, Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty\r\nsixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.'", "'Come,' said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying\r\nto his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;\r\n'Come, Oliver!", "Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't\r\ncry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'", "On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all\r\nhe would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the\r\ngentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like\r\nit very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:\r\nthe rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in\r\neither particular, there was no telling what would be done to him.", "At\r\nthe expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned\r\nwith the cocked hat, and said aloud:\r\n\r\n'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'", "Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat\r\ncontradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his\r\noffering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining\r\nroom: the door of which was open.", "The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the\r\nlittle bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had\r\nbeen stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.", "Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.", "'He doats on it, your worship,' replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly\r\npinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn't.", "'You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,\r\nopen-hearted man,' said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in\r\nthe direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium, whose villainous\r\ncountenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.", "It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate.", "If the inkstand had been\r\nwhere the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen\r\ninto it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been\r\nstraightway hurried off.", "But, as it chanced to be immediately under\r\nhis nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over\r\nhis desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\r\nsearch to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\r\nterrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\r\nand pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\r\nfuture master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\r\npalpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.", "The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to\r\nMr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and\r\nunconcerned aspect.", "Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that\r\nthey would order him back to the dark room--that they would starve\r\nhim--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send him away with\r\nthat dreadful man.", "of all the artful and designing orphans\r\nthat ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.'", "That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively\r\nand decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he\r\nwould be drawn and quartered into the bargain.", "The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\r\nagain To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would\r\ntake possession of him.", "CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC\r\nLIFE\r\n\r\nIn great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,\r\neither in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the\r\nyoung man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to\r\nsea.", "The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took\r\ncounsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\r\nsome small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.", "The more the case presented itself to the board, in\r\nthis point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step\r\nappeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of\r\nproviding for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.", "Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\r\nmind, he made him his theme.", "Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;\r\nand it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening 'upon\r\nliking'--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that\r\nif the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out\r\nof a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for\r\na term of years, to do what he likes with.", "When little Oliver was taken before 'the gentlemen' that evening; and\r\ninformed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\r\ncoffin-maker's; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\r\ncame back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\r\ndrowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\r\nlittle emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\r\nyoung rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.", "The simple fact was,\r\nthat Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather\r\ntoo much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state\r\nof brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.", "For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\r\nfor the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\r\nand, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\r\nthe skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\r\ngreat advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.", "'Oliver!'", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.", "Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of\r\nhis unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them\r\nwhen he looked up at his conductor.", "Of _all_ the\r\nungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are\r\nthe--'\r\n\r\n'No, no, sir,' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\r\nwell-known cane; 'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I\r\nwill, sir!", "Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some\r\nastonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\r\nmanner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,'\r\nbade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy.", "Oliver made a bow.", "said the undertaker:  raising the candle\r\nabove his head, to get a better view of Oliver.", "Oliver bowed again.", "'Why, he _is_ rather small,' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\r\nif it were his fault that he was no bigger; 'he is small.", "With\r\nthis, the undertaker's wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down\r\na steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the\r\nante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated 'kitchen'; wherein sat a\r\nslatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very\r\nmuch out of repair.", "'Here, Charlotte,' said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,\r\n'give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.", "Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was\r\ntrembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a\r\nplateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.", "I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\r\nwithin him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\r\nOliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.", "I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver\r\ntore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.", "'Well,' said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his\r\nsupper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful\r\nauguries of his future appetite: 'have you done?'", "There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the\r\naffirmative.", "Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.", "CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.", "GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST\r\nTIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER'S BUSINESS\r\n\r\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp\r\ndown on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling\r\nof awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be\r\nat no loss to understand.", "Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.", "Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of\r\nthe shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was\r\nrepeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.", "'I will, directly, sir,' replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning\r\nthe key.", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'Ten, sir,' replied Oliver.", "Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very\r\nexpressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the\r\nsmallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would\r\nredeem his pledge, most honourably.", "For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,\r\nand over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had\r\naddressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm\r\nhimself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post\r\nin front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut\r\ninto wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then\r\nconsumed with great dexterity.", "'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver at length: seeing that no other\r\nvisitor made his appearance; 'did you knock?'", "inquired Oliver, innocently.", "At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver\r\nwould want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that\r\nway.", "'No, sir,' rejoined Oliver.", "With this, Mr.\r\nClaypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a\r\ndignified air, which did him great credit.", "Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in\r\nhis effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a\r\nsmall court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the\r\nday, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the\r\nassurance that 'he'd catch it,' condescended to help him.", "Oliver having 'caught it,' in fulfilment of Noah's\r\nprediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.", "Oliver, shut that door at\r\nMister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover\r\nof the bread-pan.", "said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\r\nwhich she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\r\nat poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\r\ncorner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\r\nreserved for him.", "Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a\r\nmonth.", "Mr.\r\nSowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his\r\nproposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should\r\nbe at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this\r\nview, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of\r\nhis services being required.", "'Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!'", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\r\nsight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\r\nthe mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.", "He needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance,\r\nhowever; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\r\nnow the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\r\navoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\r\nand all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\r\nshould be thus effectually and legally overcome.", "Oliver, put on your cap,\r\nand come with me.'", "Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his\r\nprofessional mission.", "There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver\r\nand his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark\r\npassage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the\r\nundertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.", "He stepped in; Oliver\r\nfollowed him.", "Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept\r\ninvoluntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the\r\nboy felt that it was a corpse.", "Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.", "He\r\ndisengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver\r\nafter him, hurried away.", "The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\r\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\r\nMr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\r\nworkhouse, who were to act as bearers.", "Mr. Bumble and\r\nSowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\r\nwere not so long as his master's, ran by the side.", "'Well, Oliver,' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, 'how do you like\r\nit?'", "'Pretty well, thank you, sir' replied Oliver, with considerable\r\nhesitation.", "'Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,' said Sowerberry.", "Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time\r\nto get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.", "CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND\r\nRATHER ASTONISHES HIM\r\n\r\nThe month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.", "In commercial phrase, coffins were\r\nlooking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great\r\ndeal of experience.", "The oldest\r\ninhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so\r\nprevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful\r\nprocessions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to\r\nhis knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the\r\nmothers in the town.", "As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his\r\nadult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\r\nof demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\r\nfinished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\r\nbeautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\r\npeople bear their trials and losses.", "All\r\nthis was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with\r\ngreat admiration.", "That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\r\npeople, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\r\nwith any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\r\nmany months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\r\nill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\r\nthat his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\r\nblack stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\r\nthe muffin-cap and leathers.", "Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah\r\ndid; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry\r\nwas disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and\r\na glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\r\ncomfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in\r\nthe grain department of a brewery.", "And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver's history; for I\r\nhave to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,\r\nbut which indirectly produced a material change in all his future\r\nprospects and proceedings.", "One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\r\ndinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a\r\nhalf of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of\r\nthe way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,\r\nbeing hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\r\nworthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.", "Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\r\ntable-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and\r\nexpressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced\r\nhis intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable\r\nevent should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty\r\nannoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.", "But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and\r\nin his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want\r\nto be funny.", "'She's dead,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say anything about her to me!'", "Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\r\nwas a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\r\nthought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.", "'Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,' replied Oliver:\r\nmore as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah.", "'Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work'us,' said Noah, as a tear\r\nrolled down Oliver's cheek.", "'Not _you_,' replied Oliver, sharply.", "'Yer know, Work'us,' continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence,\r\nand speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most\r\nannoying: 'Yer know, Work'us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer\r\ncouldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all\r\nare, and pity yer very much.", "inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.", "Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;\r\nseized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till\r\nhis teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into\r\none heavy blow, felled him to the ground.", "Oliver's gone mad!", "screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her\r\nutmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man\r\nin particularly good training.", "And between every syllable, Charlotte\r\ngave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,\r\nfor the benefit of society.", "Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not\r\nbe effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into\r\nthe kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she\r\nscratched his face with the other.", "When they were all\r\nwearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,\r\nstruggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and\r\nthere locked him up.", "Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level\r\nwith the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his\r\nwrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed\r\nsome affecting tears and sniffs.", "Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in\r\nquestion, rendered this occurance highly probable.", "'No, no,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old\r\nfriend.", "CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused\r\nnot once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate.", "said Noah:  'Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'\r\n\r\n'What?", "And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body\r\ninto an extensive variety of eel-like positions;

and, then,\r\napplying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\r\n\r\n'Oliver!'", "replied Oliver, from the inside.", "'Do you know this here voice, Oliver?'", "'Yes,' replied Oliver.", "replied Oliver, boldly.", "The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\r\nbestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\r\nwould eat;

his face\r\nwas bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.", "said Sowerberry; giving\r\nOliver a shake, and a box on the ear.", "'He called my mother names,' replied Oliver.", "'She didn't' said Oliver.", "said Oliver.", "If he had\r\nhesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be\r\nquite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,\r\naccording to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a\r\nbrute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of\r\na man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital\r\nwithin the limits of this chapter.", "It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the\r\ngloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings\r\nwhich the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a\r\nmere child.", "For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude.", "With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the\r\nshutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.", "Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\r\nMr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.", "Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.", "Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than\r\nhimself, he had been his little friend and playmate.", "said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his\r\nthin arm between the rails to greet him.", "'You musn't say you saw me, Dick,' said Oliver.", "'Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b'ye to you,' replied Oliver.", "I\r\nknow the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of\r\nHeaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.", "Kiss me,' said the child,  climbing up the low gate, and flinging his\r\nlittle arms round Oliver's neck.", "The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that\r\nOliver had ever heard invoked upon his head;

so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular\r\npurpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and\r\ntrudged on.", "Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing\r\nbut the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he\r\nbegged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.", "Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,\r\nbut was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.", "This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out\r\nof those villages with all possible expedition.", "If he\r\nbegged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the\r\ndog on him;

but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire\r\nhow he came there.", "He took little heed of this at first; but\r\nthe boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long,\r\nthat Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.", "Upon this,\r\nthe boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\r\n\r\n'Hullo, my covey!", "The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his\r\nown age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even\r\nseen.", "said this strange young gentleman\r\nto Oliver.", "'I am very hungry and tired,' replied Oliver: the tears standing in his\r\neyes as he spoke.", "But,' he added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, 'I\r\nsuppose you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.'", "Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird's mouth\r\ndescribed by the term in question.", "inquired Oliver.", "Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent\r\nchandler's shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham\r\nand a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, 'a fourpenny\r\nbran!'", "Here, a pot of beer\r\nwas brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,\r\nfalling to, at his new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal,\r\nduring the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time\r\nwith great attention.", "said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length\r\nconcluded.", "inquired Oliver.", "'I do, indeed,' answered Oliver.", "This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\r\nespecially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the\r\nold gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a\r\ncomfortable place, without loss of time.", "This led to a more friendly\r\nand confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his\r\nfriend's name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and\r\nprotege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.", "Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\r\ncomforts which his patron's interest obtained for those whom he took\r\nunder his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute\r\nmode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate\r\nfriends he was better known by the sobriquet of 'The Artful Dodger,'\r\nOliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the\r\nmoral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon\r\nhim.", "John's Road;

and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.", "'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my friend Oliver Twist.'", "The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\r\nhand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.", "'We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,' said the Jew.", "'Dodger,\r\ntake off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.", "We've just looked 'em out, ready for the\r\nwash; that's all, Oliver; that's all.", "Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot\r\ngin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because\r\nanother gentleman wanted the tumbler.", "Oliver did as he was desired.", "CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,\r\nAND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\r\n\r\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.", "Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly\r\nawake.", "Oliver was precisely in this condition.", "Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he\r\ndid not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at\r\nOliver, and called him by his name.", "He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,\r\nfrom some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on\r\nthe table.", "At least half a\r\ndozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed\r\nwith equal pleasure;

the boy's eyes were\r\nfixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\r\nfor an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\r\nconceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.", "He trembled\r\nvery much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the\r\nknife quivered in the air.", "'I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,' replied Oliver, meekly.", "replied Oliver.", "'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, earnestly.", "you're a brave boy, Oliver.'", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'They--they're mine, Oliver;\r\nmy little property.", "Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\r\nsuch a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\r\nhis fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\r\nmoney, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\r\nmight get up.", "Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to\r\nraise the pitcher.", "He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\r\nthe basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when\r\nthe Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\r\nOliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\r\nintroduced to him as Charley Bates.", "'Well,' said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\r\nto the Dodger, 'I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?'", "Ingenious workman,\r\nain't he, Oliver?'", "'Very indeed, sir,' said Oliver.", "At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed\r\nuproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to\r\nlaugh at, in anything that had passed.", "You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall\r\nbe picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it.", "Shall\r\nus, Oliver, eh?", "'If you please, sir,' said Oliver.", "'Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,' replied Oliver.", "The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair over his eyes,\r\nand said he'd know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,\r\nobserving Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking\r\nwhether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?", "This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies\r\nof the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally\r\nwondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very\r\nindustrious.", "At such times, he would\r\nlook constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping\r\nall his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a\r\nvery funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran\r\ndown his face.", "Being\r\nremarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them\r\nvery nice girls indeed.", "This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\r\nafterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\r\naway together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\r\nmoney to spend.", "inquired Oliver.", "'Yes, sir,' said Oliver.", "Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen\r\nthe Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with\r\nthe other.", "'Here it is, sir,' said Oliver, showing it in his hand.", "'You're a clever boy, my dear,' said the playful old gentleman, patting\r\nOliver on the head approvingly.", "Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to\r\ndo with his chances of being a great man.", "CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW\r\nASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE.", "BEING A SHORT,\r\nBUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out\r\nof the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\r\nhome,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\r\nthe two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.", "Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what\r\nhe had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character.", "At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\r\neagerly sought.", "Perhaps these\r\nwere reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether\r\nthey were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the\r\njoint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.", "The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\r\nand his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\r\nhands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\r\nwere going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,\r\nfirst.", "The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,\r\nthat Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive\r\nthe old gentleman, by not going to work at all.", "These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\r\nhis intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\r\nhis thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\r\nmysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.", "demanded Oliver.", "said Oliver.", "Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he\r\nwas not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked\r\nstealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman\r\ntowards whom his attention had been directed.", "Oliver walked a few paces\r\nafter them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood\r\nlooking on in silent amazement.", "What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\r\non with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\r\nDodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from\r\nthence a handkerchief!", "In the very instant when Oliver\r\nbegan to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and\r\nmissing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.", "They no sooner heard the cry, and\r\nsaw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they\r\nissued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting 'Stop thief!'", "Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not\r\ntheoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that\r\nself-preservation is the first law of nature.", "Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,\r\nlooking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when\r\nthe old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by\r\nthe foremost of the pursuers.", "The follow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his\r\npains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of\r\ndislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away\r\nhimself:  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and\r\nthus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is\r\ngenerally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made\r\nhis way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.", "Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,'\r\nsaid Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.", "Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his\r\nfeet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at\r\na rapid pace.", "The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side;\r\nand as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,\r\nand stared back at Oliver from time to time.", "The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two\r\nor three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led\r\nbeneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of\r\nsummary justice, by the back way.", "'A young fogle-hunter,' replied the man who had Oliver in charge.", "This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he\r\nunlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.", "The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated\r\nin the lock.", "But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's\r\nfeatures bore a trace.", "Mr. Fang sat\r\nbehind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of\r\nwooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling\r\nvery much at the awfulness of the scene.", "The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the\r\ncharge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person;\r\nand how that was all he knew about it.", "Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.", "He bent over Oliver, and repeated the\r\ninquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the\r\nquestion; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the\r\nmagistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he\r\nhazarded a guess.", "'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again pretending to\r\nreceive Oliver's answer.", "At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking\r\nround with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of\r\nwater.", "Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in\r\na fainting fit.", "Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on\r\nthe pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with\r\nwater; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole\r\nframe.", "A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the\r\nseat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.", "CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.", "The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\r\nOliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the\r\nDodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at\r\nIslington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady\r\nstreet near Pentonville.", "But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of\r\nhis new friends.", "said Oliver.", "With those words,\r\nthe old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and,\r\nsmoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving\r\nin his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in\r\nhers, and drawing it round his neck.", "'Perhaps she does see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands\r\ntogether; 'perhaps she has sat by me.", "'I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off;\r\nand they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor\r\nboy.", "She can't know anything\r\nabout me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence.", "The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her\r\nspectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were\r\npart and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver\r\nto drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very\r\nquiet, or he would be ill again.", "So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the\r\nkind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he\r\nwas completely exhausted with what he had already said.", "'Yes, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'No, sir,' answered Oliver.", "'No, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'Yes, sir, rather thirsty,' answered Oliver.", "Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly\r\ntwelve o'clock.", "Putting the latter on her head and the former on the\r\ntable, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up\r\nwith him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series\r\nof short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings\r\nforward, and divers moans and chokings.", "Oliver lay awake for some time,\r\ncounting the little circles of light which the reflection of the\r\nrushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid\r\neyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.", "It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt\r\ncheerful and happy.", "'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver.", "And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming\r\nup, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver\r\nthought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation\r\nstrength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest\r\ncomputation.", "inquired the old lady, seeing that\r\nOliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung\r\nagainst the wall; just opposite his chair.", "'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from\r\nthe canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know.", "said Oliver.", "asked Oliver.", "'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver.", "'Oh no, no,' returned Oliver quickly; 'but the eyes look so sorrowful;\r\nand where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.", "It makes my heart beat,'\r\nadded Oliver in a low voice, 'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak\r\nto me, but couldn't.'", "Oliver _did_ see it in his mind's eye as distinctly as if he had not\r\naltered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind\r\nold lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,\r\nsatisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of\r\ntoasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a\r\npreparation.", "Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.", "Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no\r\nsooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands\r\nbehind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at\r\nOliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd\r\ncontortions.", "Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and\r\nmade an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his\r\nbenefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;\r\nand the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart,\r\nbeing large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane\r\ndisposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic\r\nprocess which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a\r\ncondition to explain.", "'Very happy, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little invalid:  with a look of\r\ngreat astonishment.", "'Oliver,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'Oliver what?", "Oliver White, eh?'", "'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'", "'I never told him so, sir,' returned Oliver in amazement.", "This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked\r\nsomewhat sternly in Oliver's face.", "But, although his motive for\r\nlooking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the\r\nresemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him\r\nso strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.", "said Oliver, raising his eyes\r\nbeseechingly.", "As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and\r\nthen to the boy's face.", "Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being\r\nstrong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.", "A\r\nweakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of\r\nrelieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils\r\nof the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording--\r\n\r\nThat when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined\r\nin the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence\r\nof their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal\r\nproperty, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very\r\nlaudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the\r\nfreedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the\r\nfirst and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need\r\nhardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt\r\nthem in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great\r\na degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\r\npreservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code\r\nof laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid\r\ndown as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said\r\nphilosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to\r\nmatters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment\r\nto her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight\r\nany considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.", "If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of\r\nthe conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate\r\npredicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a\r\nforegoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when\r\nthe general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for\r\ntheir home by the shortest possible cut.", "CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,\r\nCONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING\r\nTO THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n'Where's Oliver?'", "After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes\r\ncondescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious\r\nact led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's\r\ncapture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and\r\nimprovements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable\r\nunder the circumstances.", "It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject,\r\nhowever; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver\r\nhad seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.", "But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or\r\nknew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in\r\nthe striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and\r\nlamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of\r\nthe street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear\r\nbrother.", "In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the\r\ndeeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,\r\nand discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to\r\nhave been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the\r\nprosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own\r\nresidence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that\r\nit was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in\r\nthe directions to the coachman.", "With these words, he pushed them from the room:  and carefully\r\ndouble-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of\r\nconcealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.", "CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR.

and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\r\nroll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think\r\nthat they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger\r\nof his ever being able to wear them again.", "They were sad rags, to tell\r\nthe truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.", "One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was\r\nsitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.\r\nBrownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see\r\nhim in his study, and talk to him a little while.", "Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented\r\ngrievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little\r\nfrill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and\r\nhandsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so\r\nfar as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to\r\nfoot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the\r\nlongest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.", "Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.", "When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book\r\naway from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.", "Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read\r\nsuch a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world\r\nwiser.", "Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver\r\nTwist, every day of their lives.", "said Mr.\r\nBrownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the\r\nshelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.", "'A great number, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,' said Oliver, pointing to\r\nsome large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.", "'Not always those,' said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,\r\nand smiling as he did so; 'there are other equally heavy ones, though\r\nof a much smaller size.", "'I think I would rather read them, sir,' replied Oliver.", "Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it\r\nwould be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old\r\ngentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.", "Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it\r\nwas.", "'Thank you, sir,' said Oliver.", "At the earnest manner of his reply, the\r\nold gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious\r\ninstinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention\r\nto.", "'Now,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the\r\nsame time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him\r\nassume yet, 'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am\r\ngoing to say.", "exclaimed\r\nOliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's\r\ncommencement!", "'My dear child,' said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of\r\nOliver's sudden appeal; 'you need not be afraid of my deserting you,\r\nunless you give me cause.'", "'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver.", "As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to\r\nhis companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:\r\nOliver sat quite still.", "Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\r\nthe point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\nfarm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\nimpatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\r\nservant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.", "Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was\r\nan old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in\r\nhis manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason\r\nto know.", "inquired Oliver.", "looking at Oliver, and retreating a\r\npace or two.", "'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr.\r\nBrownlow.", "Oliver bowed.", "Then, still keeping his stick\r\nin his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he\r\nwore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,\r\nseeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.", "'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.", "Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about\r\nto say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell\r\nMrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the\r\nvisitor's manner, he was very happy to do.", "'And which is Oliver?'", "'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young\r\nOliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.'", "Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.\r\nGrimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and\r\nmanner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for\r\ncontradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the\r\norange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to\r\nhim whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the\r\nfirst, to oppose his friend.", "When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one\r\npoint of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he\r\nhad postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he\r\nthought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled\r\nmaliciously.", "All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous\r\ngentleman:  knowing his friend's peculiarities, bore with great good\r\nhumour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his\r\nentire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and\r\nOliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than\r\nhe had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence.", "'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of\r\nthe life and adventures of Oliver Twist?'", "asked Grimwig of Mr.\r\nBrownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as\r\nhe resumed his subject.", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.", "Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran\r\nanother; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;\r\nbut there was no boy in sight.", "Oliver and the girl returned, in a\r\nbreathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.", "'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; 'he\r\nwill be sure to deliver them safely, you know.'", "'Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,' said Oliver.", "The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out\r\non any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined\r\nhim that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the\r\ncommission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on\r\nthis head at least:  at once.", "Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in\r\na great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to\r\ntake.", "'I won't be ten minutes, sir,' said Oliver, eagerly.", "Mrs.\r\nBedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions\r\nabout the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of\r\nthe street:  all of which Oliver said he clearly understood.", "At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned\r\nthe corner.", "It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\r\nown judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\r\nhasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\r\nbad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\r\nhis respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\r\nand strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.", "CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\nWERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\nLittle Saffron Hill;

who now saw her face for the first\r\ntime; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.", "said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with\r\na white dog at his heels; 'young Oliver!", "cried\r\nOliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp.", "rejoined the man, administering another\r\nblow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.", "*      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe gas-lamps were lighted;

and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were\r\nanxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.", "Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually\r\nendearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl\r\nfor the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.", "It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been\r\nGrosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary.", "The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle\r\nthrough the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the\r\nstreets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger\r\nin Oliver's eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and\r\ndepressing.", "With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency\r\nto jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step\r\nout again.", "But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in\r\nher face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly\r\nwhite.", "Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.", "'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.", "The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,\r\nseemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish\r\neven the form of the speaker in the darkness.", "The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of\r\nrecognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin;

for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being\r\ntaken back.", "'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,\r\nhad been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; 'beautiful\r\nwriting, isn't is, Oliver?'", "At sight of the dismayed look with which\r\nOliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a\r\nlively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more\r\nboisterous than the first.", "'They belong to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, wringing his hands;\r\n'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had\r\nme nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.", "With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate\r\ngrief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands\r\ntogether, in perfect desperation.", "'You're right, Oliver, you're\r\nright; they WILL think you have stolen 'em.", "Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being\r\nspoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what\r\npassed;

and here, with\r\nmany uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old\r\nsuit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon\r\nleaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to\r\nFagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue\r\nreceived, of his whereabout.", "Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.", "Master Bates rolling up the new\r\nclothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the\r\ndark, and locking the door behind him.", "The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who\r\nopportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other\r\nfeminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept\r\nmany people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which\r\nOliver was placed.", "CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nOLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON\r\nTO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\r\n\r\nIt is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to\r\npresent the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as\r\nthe layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.", "If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the\r\npart of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver\r\nTwist was born;

of\r\nwhich he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\r\nextent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\r\nfriends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\r\nmuch trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.", "Mr. Fagin\r\nlaid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and\r\ncherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished\r\nwith hunger;

and, with\r\ngreat friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious\r\nhopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that\r\nunpleasant operation.", "Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words, and\r\nimperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.", "The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that\r\nif he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they\r\nwould be very good friends yet.", "And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many\r\nsubsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and\r\nleft during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts.", "From all of these tokens Oliver concluded\r\nthat a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to\r\nbetter people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and\r\ndreary as it looked now.", "Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;\r\nand sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would\r\nscamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.", "There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no\r\nshutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for\r\nhours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused\r\nand crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.", "Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the\r\nparapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;\r\nand as the window of Oliver's observatory was nailed down, and dimmed\r\nwith the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make\r\nout the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any\r\nattempt to be seen or heard,--which he had as much chance of being, as\r\nif he had lived inside the ball of St.", "One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\r\nevening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\r\nevince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him\r\njustice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with\r\nthis end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in\r\nhis toilet, straightway.", "Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some\r\nfaces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those\r\nabout him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the\r\nway of this proposal.", "He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief\r\nspace; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,\r\nhalf in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\r\n\r\n'What a pity it is he isn't a prig!'", "'I think I know that,' replied Oliver, looking up.", "inquired Oliver, checking himself.", "'Why don't you put yourself under\r\nFagin, Oliver?'", "'I don't like it,' rejoined Oliver, timidly; 'I wish they would let me\r\ngo.", "Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to\r\nexpress his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his\r\nboot-cleaning.", "'You can leave your friends, though,' said Oliver with a half smile;\r\n'and let them be punished for what you did.'", "Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection\r\nof Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was\r\ninhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and\r\ndown into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,\r\nabout five minutes long.", "'It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?'", "'I don't know what that means,' replied Oliver.", "'You've been brought up bad,' said the Dodger, surveying his boots with\r\nmuch satisfaction when Oliver had polished them.", "You'd better begin at once; for you'll come\r\nto the trade long before you think of it; and you're only losing time,\r\nOliver.'", "Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his\r\nown:  which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched\r\ninto a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the\r\nlife they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the\r\nbest thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin's favour without more\r\ndelay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.", "'If you don't take pocket-handkechers and watches,' said the Dodger,\r\nreducing his conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity, 'some\r\nother cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse,\r\nand you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha'p'orth the\r\nbetter, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a right\r\nto them as they have.'", "said the Jew, who had entered unseen by\r\nOliver.", "The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had\r\nreturned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver\r\nhad never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom\r\nChitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few\r\ngallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.", "'Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?'", "'I--I--don't know, sir,' replied Oliver.", "inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at\r\nOliver.", "After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew\r\ntheir chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\r\nsit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\r\ninterest his hearers.", "From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost\r\nconstant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with\r\nthe Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr.\r\nFagin best knew.", "At other times the old man would tell them stories of\r\nrobberies he had committed in his younger days:  mixed up with so much\r\nthat was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing\r\nheartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better\r\nfeelings.", "The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of\r\nWhitechapel.", "The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to\r\nimply a doubt of its reception;

Fagin craftily\r\nobserving, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\nbe more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\nhis behalf, than anybody else.", "It was also solemnly arranged that poor\r\nOliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\r\nunreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\r\nand further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\r\nfit;

but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.", "'Indeed I don't know, sir,' replied Oliver.", "The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater\r\ncuriosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\r\nvery anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\r\nFagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\r\njust then.", "replied Oliver, softly.", "Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to\r\nlight it.", "'Take heed, Oliver!", "Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and\r\npondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.", "Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.", "Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.", "asked Oliver.", "cried Oliver, 'What is it?'", "Oliver stirred the fire.", "asked Oliver.", "asked Oliver, recoiling.", "'I don't believe it,' said Oliver:  who had watched her closely.", "Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl's better\r\nfeelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion\r\nfor his helpless state.", "Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with\r\ngreat surprise.", "She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,\r\nblowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs.", "A hackney-cabriolet was in\r\nwaiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing\r\nOliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.", "The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into\r\nhis ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.", "For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty\r\nstreet, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.", "'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for the\r\nsake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it.", "Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and\r\nthrew it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat\r\nhimself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.", "Oliver replied in the affirmative.", "Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;\r\nand Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and\r\ndeliberation.", "'Yes, I see it is, sir,' replied Oliver.", "'Well,' said the robber, grasping Oliver's wrist, and putting the\r\nbarrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the\r\nboy could not repress a start; 'if you speak a word when you're out\r\no'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in\r\nyour head without notice.", "'The short and the long of what you mean,' said Nancy:  speaking very\r\nemphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his\r\nserious attention to her words:  'is, that if you're crossed by him in\r\nthis job you have on hand, you'll prevent his ever telling tales\r\nafterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance\r\nof swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way\r\nof business, every month of your life.'", "Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\r\nappetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\r\nand water, and threw himself on the bed;

bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange\r\nobjects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as\r\nif in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.", "Sikes alighted, took\r\nOliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.", "On looking intently forward, Oliver\r\nsaw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to\r\nthe foot of a bridge.", "thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.", "Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly approached the low\r\nporch, and raised the latch.", "you get on first,' said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.", "Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;\r\nand they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken\r\nchairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his legs much\r\nhigher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long\r\nclay pipe.", "Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes\r\nrested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting\r\nposture, and demanded who that was.", "exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.", "'There--there's enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and\r\nstooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his\r\near:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with\r\na long stare of astonishment.", "Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool\r\nto the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing\r\nwhere he was, or what was passing around him.", "'Indeed,' said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man's face;\r\n'indeed, I--'\r\n\r\n'Down with it!'", "Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily\r\nswallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a\r\nviolent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and\r\neven drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.", "This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat\r\nnothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the\r\ntwo men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.", "Oliver\r\nretained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched\r\nhimself on the floor:  close outside the fender.", "Oliver fell\r\ninto a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,\r\nor wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other\r\nof the scenes of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit\r\njumping up and declaring it was half-past one.", "With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney's hands, who,\r\nhaving delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on\r\nOliver's cape.", "Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the\r\nair, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand\r\nmechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.", "The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them.", "The fog was much heavier than it had been\r\nin the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,\r\nalthough no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes\r\nafter leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture\r\nthat was floating about.", "Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the\r\narms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass\r\non the other side.", "And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and\r\nterror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the\r\nobjects of the expedition.", "cried Oliver; 'let me run away and die\r\nin the fields.", "Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending\r\nOliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\r\nnoise.", "The aperture was so\r\nsmall, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to\r\ndefend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of\r\nOliver's size, nevertheless.", "'Now listen, you young limb,' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern\r\nfrom his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; 'I'm a\r\ngoing to put you through there.", "This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting\r\nupon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;\r\nand, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the\r\nfloor inside.", "Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, 'Yes.'", "'Nothing,' said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.", "Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and\r\nby a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew\r\nnot whether to advance or fly.", "Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\r\nmatron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\r\nintroduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a\r\ncheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree\r\nof complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of\r\ncorresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most\r\ngrateful meal that matrons enjoy.", "'They _called_ him Oliver,' replied the woman, feebly.", "CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR.

as if to distract the attention of those\r\nbehind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before\r\nanother hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol\r\nhigh into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.", "Still,\r\nOliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left\r\nhim.", "But, Oliver felt\r\nit not, as it beat against him; for he

poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and\r\nexhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their\r\ncompassion.", "Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,\r\nthan he uttered a loud cry.", "The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.\r\nGiles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in\r\nendeavouring to

patient thus, the\r\nyounger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the\r\nbedside, gathered Oliver's hair from his face.", "Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down\r\nto wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.", "The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial\r\nthan Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed\r\non, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.", "Oliver told them all his simple\r\nhistory, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.", "Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness\r\nand virtue watched him as he slept.", "The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to\r\nrest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them\r\nfor being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.\r\nGiles.", "Closely following Mr.\r\nLosberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles\r\npreceding the party, with a lighted candle.", "Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he\r\nhad appeared yet.", "The bewildered butler gazed from them\r\ntowards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most\r\nludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.", "said the doctor, laying\r\nOliver gently down again.", "Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\r\napartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\r\nhis respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\r\nand impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\r\nanything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\r\nhis declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put\r\nbefore him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\r\nbecause Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\r\npreviously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\r\nafraid he had been a little too hasty.", "Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very\r\nmuch about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took\r\nup their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next\r\nmorning.", "In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more\r\nconversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the\r\njoint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if\r\nhe should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded\r\nwith a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the\r\nsubject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature\r\nconsideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that\r\nthe burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the\r\nformer being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the\r\ngreat Mr. Conkey Chickweed.", "Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care\r\nof Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.", "CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nOF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\r\n\r\nOliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.", "said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\r\nendeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale\r\nlips; 'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.", "cried Oliver.", "cried Oliver; 'how kind of you to say so!'", "she inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face.", "replied Oliver eagerly; 'but I was thinking that\r\nI am ungrateful now.'", "'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care\r\nof me before,' rejoined Oliver.", "'I am sure they would,' rejoined Oliver's benefactress; 'and Mr.\r\nLosberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well\r\nenough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.'", "cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.", "In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the\r\nfatigue of this expedition.", "When\r\nthey came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a\r\nloud exclamation.", "'That, sir,' cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.", "whispered Oliver.", "He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige\r\nof anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the\r\ncupboards; answered Oliver's description!", "'As soon as I think proper,' said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other\r\nparlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to\r\nOliver's account of it.", "The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations\r\nand curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the\r\ndriver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant\r\nwith a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and\r\nvindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months\r\nafterwards.", "'Did you know\r\nthat before, Oliver?'", "If the truth must be\r\ntold, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being\r\ndisappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver's story on\r\nthe very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.", "He\r\nsoon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to\r\nhis questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still\r\ndelivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever\r\nbeen, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that\r\ntime forth.", "As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,\r\nthey were enabled to drive straight thither.", "replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.", "cried Oliver.", "Oliver looked up\r\nat the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.", "'Knock at the next door,' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in\r\nhis.", "Oliver clasped his hands, and\r\nsank feebly backward.", "said Oliver.", "This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in\r\nthe midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times\r\nduring his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.\r\nBedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how\r\nmany long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had\r\ndone for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them.", "Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the\r\nbanker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\r\nthey departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\r\nOliver with them.", "Oliver, whose days had\r\nbeen spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and\r\nbrawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.", "Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave\r\nin which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;\r\nbut, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease\r\nto think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly,\r\nbut without pain.", "Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman,\r\nwho lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to\r\nwrite:  and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could\r\nnever try enough to please him.", "There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver\r\nwould sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a\r\nperfect rapture.", "The poor\r\npeople were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that\r\nit seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there\r\ntogether; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and\r\nsounded more musical (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever\r\nheard in church before.", "Then, there were the walks as usual, and many\r\ncalls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver\r\nread a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all\r\nthe week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and\r\npleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.", "In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the\r\nfields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild\r\nflowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took\r\ngreat care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the\r\nembellishment of the breakfast-table.", "There was fresh groundsel, too,\r\nfor Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the\r\nsubject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the\r\ncages, in the most approved taste.", "When the birds were made all spruce\r\nand smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\r\ncharity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare\r\ncricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was\r\nalways something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which\r\nOliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who\r\nwas a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until\r\nMiss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand\r\ncommendations to be bestowed on all he had done.", "So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the\r\nmost blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled\r\nhappiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity.", "With the purest\r\nand most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,\r\nsoul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of\r\nthat short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with\r\nthe old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his\r\nyoung and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment\r\nto, himself.", "CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nWHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN\r\nCHECK\r\n\r\nSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came.", "Oliver had long since\r\ngrown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in\r\nhis warm feelings of a great many people.", "Oliver hastened to comply with her request.", "Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\r\nalarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that\r\nshe affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and\r\nthey so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to\r\nretire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in\r\nbetter health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in\r\nthe morning, quite well.", "'I hope,' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, 'that nothing is the\r\nmatter?", "At length,\r\nshe said, in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n'I hope not, Oliver.", "inquired Oliver.", "exclaimed Oliver, hastily.", "said Oliver.", "She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own\r\nemotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,\r\nfor the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.", "'And consider, ma'am,' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into\r\nhis eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.", "said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver's head.", "I\r\nhad forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,\r\nfor I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the\r\nagony of separation from the objects of our love.", "Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she\r\nchecked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself\r\nup as she spoke, became composed and firm.", "'We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said\r\nMrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into\r\nhis face; 'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to\r\nMr. Losberne.", "Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.", "inquired Oliver; impatient to execute\r\nhis commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.", "Oliver\r\nglanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,\r\nat some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out.", "asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.", "With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,\r\nwithout more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.", "Meanwhile Oliver was in such a\r\ndesperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could\r\nhave jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to\r\nthe next stage.", "As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and\r\nthat no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a\r\nsomewhat lighter heart.", "cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly\r\nrecoiling.", "'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great hurry to get\r\nhome, and didn't see you were coming.'", "'I am sorry,' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild\r\nlook.", "He\r\nadvanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at\r\nhim, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit.", "Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he\r\nsupposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.", "How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,\r\nwith noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest\r\nsound from the sick chamber!", "All the livelong day, and for\r\nhours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the\r\ngarden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and\r\nshuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay\r\nstretched inside.", "Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one\r\nof the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.", "Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received\r\nfrom the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that\r\nhe might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.", "Oliver's heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside\r\nof her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven\r\nher away.", "CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nCONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\nWHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO\r\nOLIVER\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much happiness to bear.", "Oliver felt stunned and\r\nstupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,\r\nor rest.", "As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,\r\nwhose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that\r\nhe could not identify the person.", "Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same\r\nvoice called Oliver by his name.", "'Oliver, what's the news?", "cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.", "replied Oliver, hastily.", "'Quite, sir,' replied Oliver.", "The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,\r\nleaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.", "'I would not for the world, sir,' replied Oliver.", "The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the\r\nbeginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,\r\nand remained silent, for some minutes.", "Oliver thought he heard him\r\nsob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh\r\nremark--for he could well guess what his feelings were--and so stood\r\napart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.", "This done, the postboy drove off;\r\nGiles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.", "As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much\r\ninterest and curiosity at the new comer.", "Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age,\r\nhe bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have\r\nhad no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not\r\nalready spoken of her as his mother.", "Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment\r\nwhile this hurried conversation was proceeding.", "The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious\r\nquestions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's\r\nsituation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as\r\nOliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of\r\nwhich, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened\r\nwith greedy ears.", "Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for\r\nthe doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful\r\nHarry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the\r\nworthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great\r\nvariety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of\r\nsmall jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had\r\never heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident\r\nsatisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and\r\nmade Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.", "Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual\r\noccupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many\r\ndays.", "It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,\r\nthat his morning expeditions were no longer made alone.", "Harry Maylie,\r\nafter the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was\r\nseized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in\r\ntheir arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.", "If Oliver\r\nwere behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be\r\nfound; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and\r\nbrought home the fairest that blossomed.", "Oliver could not\r\nhelp noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away,\r\nalthough the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help\r\nobserving, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably\r\ncast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most\r\nexpressively, as he set forth on his morning's walk.", "Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady\r\nhad not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now\r\nand then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie.", "One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning\r\nto settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his\r\nbooks.", "Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that\r\nhis books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was\r\nstirring among the creeping plants outside.", "The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver\r\nawoke with the fear, and started up.", "CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A\r\nCONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to\r\nthe spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\r\npointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\r\nable to articulate the words, 'The Jew!", "Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\r\nMaylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\r\nOliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.", "'That,' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; 'I\r\nmissed them in an instant.'", "Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the\r\ncourse of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and\r\njust then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking\r\nhimself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to\r\npossess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting\r\nall the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.", "On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,\r\nstriking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to\r\nsearch, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time\r\nfor the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to\r\ncommunicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so\r\nvigorous a pursuit.", "There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain\r\nthat, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must\r\nhave made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could\r\nhave accomplished in so short a time.", "'It must have been a dream, Oliver,' said Harry Maylie.", "'Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied Oliver, shuddering at the very\r\nrecollection of the old wretch's countenance; 'I saw him too plainly\r\nfor that.", "'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the\r\ninn,' said Oliver.", "'As I am that the men were at the window,' replied Oliver, pointing\r\ndown, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from\r\nthe meadow.", "The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and\r\nlooking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the\r\naccuracy of what he said.", "Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,\r\nfurnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance\r\nand dress of the strangers.", "On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie\r\nrepaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something\r\nof the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.", "But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little\r\ncircle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more\r\nheard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon\r\nsome there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to\r\nremark.", "said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the\r\nbreakfast-table.", "And at night, you urge me, with great\r\nmystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of\r\nwhich is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when\r\nhe ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all\r\nkinds.", "Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?'", "'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and\r\nMr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver.", "'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, 'let me speak a word with\r\nyou.'", "Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him;\r\nmuch surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which\r\nhis whole behaviour displayed.", "'I hope so, sir,' replied Oliver.", "certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,' exclaimed Oliver,\r\ngreatly delighted with the commission.", "quite, sir, quite,' replied Oliver.", "Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,\r\nfaithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.", "'Why, you mean Oliver!", "There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'\r\n\r\n'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the\r\nstranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\r\nof poor Oliver's vices.", "He well remembered the night of old\r\nSally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good\r\nreason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.\r\nCorney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure\r\nof which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know\r\nthat it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's\r\nattendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.", "I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to\r\nold Fagin's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.'", "Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put\r\ninto your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this\r\nman--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.", "A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he\r\nshould have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a\r\nthief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.'", "\"In\r\nshort, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\r\nI'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\"'\r\n\r\n'His brother!'", "When he spoke of you and the other\r\nlady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against\r\nhim, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said\r\nthere was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds\r\nof thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who\r\nyour two-legged spaniel was.'", "'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,\r\nbenefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?'", "While\r\nshe felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in\r\nwhich Oliver's history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the\r\nconfidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed,\r\nhad reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.", "Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but\r\nRose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's\r\nimpetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first\r\nexplosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of\r\nOliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her\r\nrepresentations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no\r\nexperienced person.", "She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\r\nhad considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\r\nwriting the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\r\nstreets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\r\nbreathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\r\ncause of alarm.", "'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to\r\narticulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we\r\nhave so often talked about.'", "'Getting out of a coach,' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,\r\n'and going into a house.", "Look here,' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, 'here\r\nit is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly!", "Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five\r\nminutes they were on their way to Craven Street.", "When they arrived\r\nthere, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\r\nold gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\r\nrequested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.", "'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose.", "'And,\r\nas the devil's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I\r\ndon't see the application of that remark.'", "Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\r\nfew natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\r\nBrownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's\r\nprivate ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\r\nfor some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\r\nbenefactor and friend.", "In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\nseat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\nreceived very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\nbeen the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,\r\nRose Maylie would have been well repaid.", "But\r\nOliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to\r\nhis first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\r\n\r\n'God be good to me!'", "cried Oliver.", "Running on thus, and now\r\nholding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to\r\nher and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul\r\nlaughed and wept upon his neck by turns.", "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\nthe way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\nof her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\nand perplexity.", "These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\r\nreturned home.", "'Are we to pass a vote of thanks to\r\nall these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred\r\npounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some\r\nslight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?'", "'Simply, the discovery of Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him the\r\ninheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently\r\ndeprived.'", "'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will\r\nbring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step\r\nin to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very\r\nQuixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to\r\nOliver's, which is the same thing.'", "I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly\r\nquiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.'", "'And as I see on the faces about me, a\r\ndisposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to\r\ncorroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me\r\nstipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may\r\ndeem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.", "Supper has been\r\nannounced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will\r\nhave begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,\r\nand entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the\r\nworld.'", "CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,\r\nBECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on\r\nher self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,\r\nby the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\r\nthis history should bestow some attention.", "'I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,\r\nthere the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's\r\nlittle history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,\r\nand if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.'", "CHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING\r\nA PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY\r\n\r\nThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when\r\nOliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a\r\ntravelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town.", "They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of\r\nagitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting\r\nhis thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less\r\neffect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.", "But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they\r\njourneyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the\r\nwhole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a\r\ncrowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into\r\nthat which he had traversed on foot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy,\r\nwithout a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.", "cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,\r\nand pointing out at the carriage window; 'that's the stile I came over;\r\nthere are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake\r\nme and force me back!", "'Yes, yes,' said Oliver, 'and we'll--we'll take him away from here, and\r\nhave him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place\r\nwhere he may grow strong and well,--shall we?'", "'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,' said\r\nOliver.", "There was Sowerberry's the undertaker's just\r\nas it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he\r\nremembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with\r\nalmost every one of which he had some slight incident connected--there\r\nwas Gamfield's cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old\r\npublic-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his\r\nyouthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there\r\nwas the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver\r\ninvoluntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so\r\nfoolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at\r\nthe doors and windows that he knew quite well--there was nearly\r\neverything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life\r\nhad been but a happy dream.", "They drove straight to the\r\ndoor of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,\r\nand think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur\r\nand size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing\r\nthe young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as\r\nif he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,\r\nand not offering to eat his head--no, not once; not even when he\r\ncontradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and\r\nmaintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and\r\nthat time fast asleep.", "All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,\r\nnervous and uncomfortable.", "At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they\r\nwere to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\r\nthe room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\r\nshrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,\r\nand it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking\r\nin with Fagin at the window of his little room.", "Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand,\r\nwalked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.", "'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his\r\nhand upon his head, 'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your\r\nfather, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who\r\ndied in giving him birth.'", "'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast.", "As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on\r\nhimself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the\r\nterrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been\r\nhis old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver\r\nensnared:  of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his\r\nbeing rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit\r\nto the country house for the purpose of identifying him.", "cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\r\n'or is that little Oliver?", "'Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the\r\nwhite waistcoat?", "he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with\r\nplated handles, Oliver.'", "'Not aunt,' cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; 'I'll never\r\ncall her aunt--sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my\r\nheart to love so dearly from the first!", "Oliver opened it, glided away,\r\nand gave place to Harry Maylie.", "'Oliver, my child,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'where have you been, and why do\r\nyou look so sad?", "The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,\r\npainted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the\r\npressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared\r\nat the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,\r\nsigned by one of the sheriffs.", "These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.", "The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,\r\nopened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and\r\nled them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.", "'Oliver, too, ha!", "Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to\r\nbed!'", "The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not\r\nto be alarmed, looked on without speaking.", "As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow.", "'Oliver,' cried Fagin, beckoning to him.", "'I am not afraid,' said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.\r\nBrownlow's hand.", "'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in a canvas\r\nbag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.", "'Yes, yes,' returned Oliver.", "The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp,\r\nheld him back.", "Oliver nearly swooned\r\nafter this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more,\r\nhe had not the strength to walk.", "It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of\r\nproperty remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered\r\neither in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided\r\nbetween himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than\r\nthree thousand pounds.", "By the provisions of his father's will, Oliver\r\nwould have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to\r\ndeprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices\r\nand pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to\r\nwhich his young charge joyfully acceded.", "Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.", "Removing with him and the old\r\nhousekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear\r\nfriends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm\r\nand earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose\r\ncondition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever\r\nbe known in this changing world.", "It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to\r\nrally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of\r\nthe night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his\r\nreturn; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in\r\nproof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which\r\nalways calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.", "They\r\nsleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among\r\nits inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to\r\nthis day the villagers have never been able to discover to which\r\nestablishment they properly belong.", "End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLIVER TWIST

string, some sausages were\r\ncooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was\r\na very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face\r\nwas obscured by a quantity of matted red hair.", "These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to\r\nthe Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.", "So did the Jew\r\nhimself, toasting-fork in hand.", "The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\r\nhand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.", "These\r\ncivilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal\r\nexercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the\r\naffectionate youths who offered them.", "'We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,' said the Jew.", "Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot\r\ngin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because\r\nanother gentleman wanted the tumbler.", "There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling\r\nsome coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to\r\nhimself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon.", "He saw the Jew with his\r\nhalf-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of\r\nthe spoon grating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the self-same\r\nsenses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with\r\nalmost everybody he had ever known.", "When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.", "After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the\r\ndoor: which he fastened.", "said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every\r\nfeature with a hideous grin.", "With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew\r\nonce more deposited the watch in its place of safety.", "Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that\r\nit lay in the palm of his hand.", "There seemed to be some very minute\r\ninscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading\r\nit with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly.", "As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been\r\nstaring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were\r\nfixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\r\nfor an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\r\nconceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.", "said the Jew.", "said the Jew, scowling fiercely on\r\nthe boy.", "cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:\r\nand a threatening attitude.", "said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,\r\nand playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to\r\ninduce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport.", "The Jew rubbed his hands with a\r\nchuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.", "said the Jew, laying\r\nhis hand upon it after a short pause.", "said the Jew, turning rather pale.", "Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\r\nsuch a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\r\nhis fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\r\nmoney, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\r\nmight get up.", "He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\r\nthe basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when\r\nthe Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\r\nOliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\r\nintroduced to him as Charley Bates.", "'Well,' said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\r\nto the Dodger, 'I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?'", "said the Jew.", "inquired the Jew, with eagerness.", "'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the\r\ninsides carefully; 'but very neat and nicely made.", "'Well,' said the Jew, inspecting them closely; 'they're very good ones,\r\nvery.", "said the Jew.", "This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\r\nafterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\r\naway together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\r\nmoney to spend.", "'Yes,' said the Jew; 'that is, unless they should unexpectedly come\r\nacross any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do,\r\nmy dear, depend upon it.", "said the Jew, stopping\r\nshort.", "cried the Jew.", "But, thinking that the Jew,\r\nbeing so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to\r\nthe table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.", "BEING A SHORT,\r\nBUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out\r\nof the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\r\nhome,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\r\nthe two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.", "In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,\r\nand the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind.", "muttered the Jew:  changing countenance; 'only two\r\nof 'em?", "said the Jew, rising with a menacing look.", "said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by\r\nthe collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.", "thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that\r\nhis keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.", "And, swinging\r\nhimself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the\r\nJew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass\r\nat the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,\r\nwould have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily\r\nreplaced.", "The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could\r\nhave been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and,\r\nseizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant's head.", "I might have know'd, as nobody\r\nbut an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to\r\nthrow away any drink but water--and not that, unless he done the River\r\nCompany every quarter.", "Mr. Sikes,' said the Jew, trembling; 'don't speak so loud!'", "'Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,' said the Jew, with abject humility.", "said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and\r\npointing towards the boys.", "Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left\r\near, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb\r\nshow which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.", "This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer\r\nwith which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard,\r\nhe might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish\r\n(at all events) to improve upon the distiller's ingenuity not very far\r\nfrom the old gentleman's merry heart.", "'I'm afraid,' said the Jew, 'that he may say something which will get\r\nus into trouble.'", "'And I'm afraid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not\r\nnoticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did\r\nso,--'I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with\r\na good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than\r\nit would for me, my dear.'", "The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.", "The Jew nodded assent.", "Again the Jew nodded.", "said the Jew.", "'Only just up to the office, my dear,' said the Jew coaxingly.", "The Jew's countenance fell.", "'Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, 'what do YOU say?'", "Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her\r\ncurl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress\r\nbeing provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared\r\nto issue forth on her errand.", "'Stop a minute, my dear,' said the Jew, producing, a little covered\r\nbasket.", "'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large\r\nstreet-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand.", "said the Jew, rubbing\r\nhis hands.", "'Ah, she's a clever girl, my dears,' said the Jew, turning round to his\r\nyoung friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition\r\nto them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.", "In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman\r\nstaggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a\r\nswift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could\r\nthink of, to the domicile of the Jew.", "'We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,' said the Jew\r\ngreatly excited.", "Stay, stay,'\r\nadded the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; 'there's money,\r\nmy dears.", "cried the Jew impatiently.", "'Yes,' replied the Jew, 'wherever she lays hands on him.", "'He has not peached so far,' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.", "As Oliver\r\nwas told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave\r\nthem to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell\r\nthem to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.", "This she very readily\r\ndid; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\r\nroll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think\r\nthat they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger\r\nof his ever being able to wear them again.", "CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\nWERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\nLittle Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\r\nburnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\r\nthe summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\r\nsmall glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\r\nvelveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\r\nthat dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\r\nto recognise as Mr. William Sikes.", "'I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,' replied Fagin, humbly; for the\r\nJew was the new comer.", "'Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,' replied the Jew.", "inquired the Jew with a forced smile.", "The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to\r\nlaugh at the pleasantry of his friend.", "'Well, well, my dear,' said the Jew, 'I know all that; we--we--have a\r\nmutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.'", "'Humph,' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on\r\nthe Jew's side than on his.", "'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew,\r\nsoothingly.", "'All,' replied the Jew.", "It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile\r\nand repulsive in appearance.", "The Jew, perfectly\r\nunderstanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a\r\nremarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if\r\nin expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the\r\naction would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third\r\nperson.", "Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining\r\nsilent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and\r\npresently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the\r\nbonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.", "Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a\r\nhalf closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was\r\ndisposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.", "The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;\r\nlooked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched\r\nfist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated\r\nhimself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the\r\ninteresting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.", "Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the\r\ncleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round\r\nand round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number\r\nof low bows to the bewildered boy.", "'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,' said the Jew, bowing\r\nwith mock humility.", "inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\r\nseized the note.", "'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew.", "The Jew started.", "inquired the\r\nJew.", "With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between\r\nthe Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,\r\nfolded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.", "With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate\r\ngrief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands\r\ntogether, in perfect desperation.", "chuckled the Jew,\r\nrubbing his hands, 'it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen\r\nour time!'", "cried Nancy, springing before the door, and\r\nclosing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.", "The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the\r\nroom, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among\r\nthem.", "said the Jew, with a threatening look.", "said the Jew, taking up\r\na jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'", "But he watched the Jew's motions, and breathed\r\nquickly.", "sneered the\r\nJew, catching the boy by the arm.", "The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and\r\nwas raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it\r\nfrom his hand.", "The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this\r\nthreat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked\r\nalternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless\r\nfrom the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.", "said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during\r\nwhich he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted\r\nmanner; 'you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.", "The Jew saw that it would be\r\nhopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\r\nNancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\r\nglance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\r\nhe was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.", "'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory\r\ntone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all\r\nthat passed; 'we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.'", "'Well, well,' replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; 'and,\r\nif you have, it's your living!'", "interposed the Jew, goaded by these\r\nreproaches; 'a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!'", "The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a\r\ntransport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably\r\nhave left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been\r\nseized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few\r\nineffectual struggles, and fainted.", "The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have\r\nthe disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the\r\nboys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance\r\nincidental to business.", "'It's the worst of having to do with women,' said the Jew, replacing\r\nhis club; 'but they're clever, and we can't get on, in our line,\r\nwithout 'em.", "'Certainly not,' replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which\r\nCharley put the question.", "Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the\r\ncleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were\r\ntwo or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with\r\nmany uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old\r\nsuit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon\r\nleaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to\r\nFagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue\r\nreceived, of his whereabout.", "Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words, and\r\nimperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.", "That it\r\nwas possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the\r\nguilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and\r\nthat deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or\r\nover-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by\r\nthe Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,\r\nwhen he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that\r\ngentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\r\nforegone conspiracy of the kind.", "As he glanced timidly up, and met the\r\nJew's searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs\r\nwere neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.", "The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that\r\nif he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they\r\nwould be very good friends yet.", "After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;\r\nand he was at liberty to wander about the house.", "From all of these tokens Oliver concluded\r\nthat a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to\r\nbetter people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and\r\ndreary as it looked now.", "With\r\nthese exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living\r\nthing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from\r\nroom to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the\r\nstreet-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain\r\nthere, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys\r\nreturned.", "'And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,' said the Dodger, as the Jew\r\nwas heard unlocking the door above, 'if you don't take fogels and\r\ntickers--'\r\n\r\n'What's the good of talking in that way?'", "said the Jew, who had entered unseen by\r\nOliver.", "The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had\r\nreturned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver\r\nhad never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom\r\nChitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few\r\ngallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.", "inquired the\r\nJew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the\r\ntable.", "'A young friend of mine, my dear,' replied the Jew.", "After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew\r\ntheir chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\r\nsit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\r\ninterest his hearers.", "These were, the great advantages of the trade,\r\nthe proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the\r\nliberality of the Jew himself.", "From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost\r\nconstant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with\r\nthe Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr.\r\nFagin best knew.", "In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.", "CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nIN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his\r\ngreat-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up\r\nover his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face:\r\nemerged from his den.", "The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the\r\nstreet; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck\r\noff in the direction of the Spitalfields.", "It seemed just the night when it befitted such a\r\nbeing as the Jew to be abroad.", "The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be\r\nat all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the\r\nintricacies of the way.", "'Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,' said the Jew looking in.", "Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer\r\ngarment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a\r\nchair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his\r\ntail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his\r\nnature to be.", "'Well, my dear,' replied the Jew.--'Ah!", "'It is cold, Nancy dear,' said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands\r\nover the fire.", "Sikes pouring out a glass of\r\nbrandy, bade the Jew drink it off.", "'Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,' replied the Jew, putting down the\r\nglass after just setting his lips to it.", "inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.", "The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second\r\nglassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a\r\nrestless and suspicious manner habitual to him.", "inquired the Jew.", "said the Jew, drawing his chair\r\nforward, and speaking in a very low voice.", "you know what I mean, my dear,' said the Jew.", "said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop\r\nthis burst of indignation; 'somebody will hear us, my dear.", "'There, there,' said the Jew, coaxingly.", "said the Jew:  rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in\r\na rapture of anticipation.", "echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.", "'Then it hasn't been properly gone about,' said the Jew, turning pale\r\nwith anger.", "'Do you mean to tell me, Bill,' said the Jew: softening as the other\r\ngrew heated:  'that neither of the two men in the house can be got\r\nover?'", "'But do you mean to say, my dear,' remonstrated the Jew, 'that the\r\nwomen can't be got over?'", "said the Jew incredulously.", "'He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my\r\ndear,' said the Jew.", "The Jew looked blank at this information.", "A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep\r\nthought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy\r\nperfectly demoniacal.", "'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.", "'Yes, my dear, yes,' rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every\r\nmuscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had\r\nawakened.", "'Then,' said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain,\r\n'let it come off as soon as you like.", "asked the Jew eagerly.", "said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost\r\nstarting out of it.", "cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her\r\nhead, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's\r\nface.", "'As you like, my dear, as you like' replied the Jew.", "exclaimed the Jew.", "'No more we should,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering\r\nduring this speech, and had only caught the last sentence.", "The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the\r\nfire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave\r\nthe room.", "The Jew still hesitated.", "'No, no, my dear, I know you're not,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again\r\nthe old man paused.", "'I didn't know whether she mightn't p'r'aps be out of sorts, you know,\r\nmy dear, as she was the other night,' replied the Jew.", "These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both\r\ngentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and\r\nresumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.", "said\r\nthe Jew, patting her on the neck.", "'He's the boy for you, my dear,' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;\r\nlaying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.", "'And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,' interposed the Jew;\r\n'he can't help himself.", "'I've thought of it all,' said the Jew with energy.", "'Perhaps I do, my dear,' said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle.", "'Because they're of no use to me, my dear,' replied the Jew, with some\r\nconfusion, 'not worth the taking.", "Besides,'\r\nsaid the Jew, recovering his self-possession, 'he has us now if he\r\ncould only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with\r\nus.", "'Ah, to be sure,' said the Jew; 'when is it to be done, Bill?'", "'Good,' said the Jew; 'there's no moon.'", "asked the Jew.", "After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\r\ndecided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the\r\nnight had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\r\nobserving, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\nbe more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\nhis behalf, than anybody else.", "It was also solemnly arranged that poor\r\nOliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\r\nunreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\r\nand further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\r\nfit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or\r\nevil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to\r\nrender the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\r\nMr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\r\ncorroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash\r\nToby Crackit.", "'Good-night, Nancy,' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.", "Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.", "The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the\r\nprostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped\r\ndownstairs.", "muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.", "'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away.", "At first, he was\r\npleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of\r\nhis release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting\r\ndown to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and\r\nmanner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the\r\nresidence of Bill Sikes that night.", "Not to stop there,' replied the Jew.", "'I suppose,' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, 'you want to know\r\nwhat you're going to Bill's for---eh, my dear?'", "said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from\r\na close perusal of the boy's face.", "The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater\r\ncuriosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\r\nvery anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\r\nFagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\r\njust then.", "He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very\r\nsurly and silent till night:  when he prepared to go abroad.", "'You may burn a candle,' said the Jew, putting one upon the table.", "The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he\r\nwent.", "Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to\r\nlight it.", "He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,\r\nsaw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and\r\ncontracted brows, from the dark end of the room.", "The\r\nmore he thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he was at a loss to\r\ndivine its real purpose and meaning.", "He remained\r\nlost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed\r\nthe candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,\r\nbegan to read.", "All was\r\nso quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he\r\nwas, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to\r\nwhich the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening.", "'Here,' said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and\r\na bottle upon the table,  'Success to the crack!'", "Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very\r\nruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of\r\nlaughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire\r\nwhat was the matter.", "said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated\r\nthat he was at no loss to understand the reason.", "my dear,' replied the Jew, 'you must get up very early in the\r\nmorning, to win against the Dodger.'", "replied the Jew, looking round as he\r\nplied the bellows.", "'Never mind him, my dear,' said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and\r\ngiving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.", "'No more it is,' replied the Jew; 'Charley will talk.", "'Ah, to be sure, my dear,' replied the Jew.", "'You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,' asked the Dodger, winking\r\nupon Charley and the Jew, 'if Bet was all right?'", "'Nobody, my dear,' replied the Jew; 'not a soul, Tom.", "'To be sure it would, my dear,' replied the Jew.", "'No, no, to be sure,' replied the Jew; 'you were too stout-hearted for\r\nthat.", "The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened\r\nto assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the\r\ncompany, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.", "cried the Jew, 'alone?'", "Having performed this\r\nfriendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his\r\ndirections.", "'Yes,' said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; 'bring him down.", "said this worthy, nodding to the Jew.", "The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon\r\nthe table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his\r\nleisure.", "At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently\r\nwatching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue\r\nto the intelligence he brought; but in vain.", "Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched\r\nevery morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room,\r\nmeanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.", "interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.", "screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.", "cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground.", "'I know it,' replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and\r\npointing to it.", "The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining\r\nhis hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.", "It was into this place that the Jew turned.", "said this\r\nrespectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew's inquiry after his\r\nhealth.", "The Jew nodded.", "inquired the Jew, with a disappointed\r\ncountenance.", "'Nothing to-night,' said the Jew, turning away.", "But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he\r\npreferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very\r\neasily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,\r\nfor a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively's presence.", "By the\r\ntime he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,\r\nafter ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight\r\nof him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a\r\nshake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and\r\nmistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.", "The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, 'Is _he_\r\nhere?'", "asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis\r\non the pronoun as before.", "said the Jew.", "If you'll wait ten minutes, he'll be--'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might\r\nbe to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his\r\nabsence.", "'Not a word now,' said the Jew, descending the stairs.", "But it's not Phil Barker's time,' said the Jew, looking up.", "The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its\r\nformer expression of anxiety and thought.", "'Now,' muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, 'if there is any\r\ndeep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you\r\nare.'", "'She has been drinking,' thought the Jew, cooly, 'or perhaps she is\r\nonly miserable.'", "During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to\r\nassure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly\r\nreturned.", "'And the boy, too,' said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse\r\nof her face.", "cried the Jew, in amazement.", "said the Jew, scornfully.", "rejoined the Jew, furiously.", "exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his\r\ncompanion's unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, 'I\r\n_will_ change it!", "croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.", "said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his\r\nhands nervously together.", "observed the Jew, keeping his\r\nglistening eye steadily upon her.", "Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a\r\nfailing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in\r\nwhich, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than\r\nchecked.", "Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva\r\nwhich pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of\r\nthe justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the\r\ntemporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into\r\ndullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the\r\ninfluence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave\r\nutterance to various exclamations of 'Never say die!'", "It blew from the right quarter for the\r\nJew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering,\r\nas every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.", "said the Jew, turning quickly round, 'is that--'\r\n\r\n'Yes!'", "'On your business, my dear,' replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his\r\ncompanion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.", "'Nothing good,' said the Jew.", "The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,\r\ninterrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this\r\ntime arrived:  remarking, that he had better say what he had got to\r\nsay, under cover:  for his blood was chilled with standing about so\r\nlong, and the wind blew through him.", "'We can say the few words we've got to say in here, my dear,' said the\r\nJew, throwing open a door on the first floor; 'and as there are holes\r\nin the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we'll set\r\nthe candle on the stairs.", "With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper\r\nflight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.", "Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat\r\nhimself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the\r\narm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.", "They might have been\r\ntalking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which\r\nname the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course\r\nof their colloquy--said, raising his voice a little,\r\n\r\n'I tell you again, it was badly planned.", "exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.", "inquired the Jew humbly.", "'But not mine,' said the Jew, submissively.", "'I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,' replied the Jew;\r\n'he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.'", "'I had no hold upon him to make him worse,' pursued the Jew, anxiously\r\nwatching the countenance of his companion.", "renewed the Jew.", "'Why, we can't afford to do that just now, my dear,' replied the Jew,\r\nsmiling; 'and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one\r\nof these days, I might be glad to have it done.", "If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and,\r\nif--if--' said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,--'it's not likely,\r\nmind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead--'\r\n\r\n'It's no fault of mine if he is!'", "interposed the other man, with a look\r\nof terror, and clasping the Jew's arm with trembling hands.", "cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both\r\narms, as he sprung to his feet.", "The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.", "'It's your fancy,' said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his\r\ncompanion.", "The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,\r\ntelling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs.", "said the Jew, when they had regained the\r\npassage.", "As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket;\r\nand explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them\r\nin, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.", "Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he\r\nthought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew's house again.", "he thought he heard the Jew say; 'it is he, sure\r\nenough.", "There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could\r\nhave almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering\r\ninto the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew!", "CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A\r\nCONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to\r\nthe spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\r\npointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\r\nable to articulate the words, 'The Jew!", "the Jew!'", "'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew,\r\nrunning a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'", "Of these, the Jew was, at all events,\r\nsufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen\r\ndrinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any\r\nintelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.", "CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY\r\nACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS\r\nTOGETHER\r\n\r\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned\r\nin the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as\r\ntherein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily\r\ngrowled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.", "'I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,' replied\r\nthe Jew.", "Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\nreceiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\nliquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\nassuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\nbetter temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\nbanter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\njokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\ncondescended to make.", "'I haven't a piece of coin about me,' replied the Jew.", "The\r\nJew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\r\nattended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\r\non the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\r\nyoung lady's return.", "The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered\r\na complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very\r\nremarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,\r\nhowever, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at\r\nthe time.", "Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to\r\nthe door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.", "The Jew:\r\nperhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he\r\nendeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and took Monks out of\r\nthe room.", "Monks went at once into the street;\r\nand the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.", "exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the\r\ncandle, 'how pale you are!'", "\"In\r\nshort, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\r\nI'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\"'\r\n\r\n'His brother!'", "There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows\r\non the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper.", "If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy's dress, there might have\r\nbeen some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had\r\ndiscarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his\r\nleathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting\r\nso much attention in a public-house.", "'That is the dabe of this 'ouse,' replied the Jew.", "'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew,\r\nsinking his voice to a confidential whisper; 'and that's the truth.'", "Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he\r\nfell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a\r\ncountenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.", "observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.", "'Only to show you my meaning clearly,' said the Jew, raising his\r\neyebrows.", "'He shall have all he wants,' continued the Jew.", "'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.", "By Fagin's\r\ndirections, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's\r\nfrock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles\r\nthe Jew had at hand.", "She remembered that\r\nboth the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes,\r\nwhich had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she\r\nwas trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.", "Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.", "'I don't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my\r\nshoulder, so take it away,' said Sikes, casting off the Jew's hand.", "'That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a whisper.", "'That's not the smallest danger in it--not the very smallest,' said the\r\nJew; 'it's only to dodge a woman.'", "Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of\r\nsuch intense excitement that it infected him.", "Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,\r\nFagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of\r\nglass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in\r\nthe adjoining room.", "But\r\nif--if--' said the gentleman, 'he cannot be secured, or, if secured,\r\ncannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.'", "Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that\r\nhe was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and\r\nmade for the Jew's house as fast as his legs would carry him.", "Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face,\r\nand reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched\r\nhis coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.", "cried the Jew, his eyes flashing\r\nwith rage.", "'Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew,\r\npointing to Sikes as he spoke.", "cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.", "The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was\r\nunable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and\r\nviolence, when the Jew came panting up.", "Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now,\r\nin your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \"_the only proofs of the\r\nboy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that\r\nreceived them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\"", "As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on\r\nhimself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow

be given up, in the event of his\r\nbeing rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit\r\nto the country house for the purpose of identifying him.", "cried the Jew, falling

and advancing to the\r\nmaster, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own\r\ntemerity:\r\n\r\n'Please, sir, I want some more.'", "Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\r\nwas a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\r\nthought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.", "In this favourable position of\r\naffairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.", "The\r\ncandle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet.", "The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and\r\nmany times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy\r\nbed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.", "The curtain at the bed's head was\r\nhastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely\r\ndressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which\r\nshe had been sitting at needle-work.", "It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase\r\nshivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.'", "A damp mist rose from the river, and the\r\nmarshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.", "He rose to honour\r\nthe toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner,\r\nadvanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its\r\ncontents.", "They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but\r\nBarney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire.", "Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet.", "When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from\r\nthe bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to\r\ncatch the heat.", "She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew\r\nback, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a\r\nsitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered\r\nsome indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.", "Suddenly, he started back at the report of\r\nfirearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights\r\ngleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand\r\nbore him hurriedly away.", "'And you, Miss Rose,' said the doctor, turning to the young lady, 'I--'\r\n\r\n'Oh!", "very much so, indeed,' said Rose, interrupting him; 'but there is\r\na poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.'", "'Rose wished to see the man,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'but I wouldn't hear of\r\nit.'", "Allow\r\nme--Miss Rose, will you permit me?", "urged Rose.", "said\r\nRose.", "'But even if he has been wicked,' pursued Rose, 'think how young he is;\r\nthink that he may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a\r\nhome; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven\r\nhim to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.", "replied Rose, eagerly.", "'Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said Rose, smiling through\r\nher tears; 'but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is\r\nindispensably necessary.'", "'You seem to think,' retorted the doctor, 'that everybody is disposed\r\nto be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose.", "'You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,' returned Rose,\r\nblushing.", "entreated Rose.", "'He cannot be hardened in vice,' said Rose; 'It is impossible.'", "Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy\r\nstate; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.", "'Surely,' said Rose, 'the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to\r\nthese men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.'", "interrupted Rose.", "demanded Rose.", "'I see it, of course,' replied Rose, smiling at the doctor's\r\nimpetuosity; 'but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the\r\npoor child.'", "cried Rose.", "exclaimed Rose, eagerly.", "inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any symptoms of\r\ngood-humour in the unwelcome visitors.", "Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short\r\ndialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,\r\nthat if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would\r\nperhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.", "Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care\r\nof Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.", "said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\r\nendeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale\r\nlips; 'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.", "The rose and\r\nhoneysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks\r\nof the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious\r\nodours.", "Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie\r\nand Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in\r\nsome shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could\r\nhave done, until it grew too dark to see the letters.", "When the birds were made all spruce\r\nand smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\r\ncharity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare\r\ncricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was\r\nalways something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which\r\nOliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who\r\nwas a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until\r\nMiss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand\r\ncommendations to be bestowed on all he had done.", "Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had\r\nwalked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their\r\nordinary bounds.", "'Rose, my dear!'", "Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words\r\nhad roused her from some painful thoughts.", "'Rose, my love!'", "replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly\r\nchillness were passing over her, while she spoke; 'I shall be better\r\npresently.", "'I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,' rejoined Rose; 'but indeed\r\nI have tried very hard, and cannot help this.", "Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\r\nalarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that\r\nshe affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and\r\nthey so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to\r\nretire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in\r\nbetter health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in\r\nthe morning, quite well.", "My dear, dear Rose!", "Rose was in the first stage of a high and\r\ndangerous fever.", "'Here is another letter,' said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; 'but\r\nwhether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I\r\nscarcely know.", "Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was\r\ndelirious.", "There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and\r\nmirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the\r\nsummer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering\r\noverhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy\r\nraised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively\r\noccurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could\r\nsurely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that\r\ngraves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and\r\nfragrance.", "He\r\nhad no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of\r\nthought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred\r\nlittle occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have\r\nbeen more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.", "'What of Rose?'", "Miss Rose!", "If Rose had--I cannot utter that word\r\nnow--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever\r\nhave forgiven yourself!", "On Rose, sweet, gentle girl!", "'Let it rest with Rose, then,' interposed Harry.", "Before I leave\r\nthis place, Rose shall hear me.'", "Before you\r\nstake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried\r\nto the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,\r\non Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her\r\ndoubtful birth may have on her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with\r\nall the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of\r\nself which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her\r\ncharacteristic.'", "'By and by,' replied the lady; 'when I leave Rose.'", "Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual\r\noccupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many\r\ndays.", "The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;\r\nand the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more\r\ngathered to gladden Rose with their beauty.", "Pending these\r\nobservations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.", "CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A\r\nCONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to\r\nthe spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\r\npointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\r\nable to articulate the words, 'The Jew!", "Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.", "But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little\r\ncircle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more\r\nheard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon\r\nsome there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to\r\nremark.", "Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a\r\nlong time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon\r\nher face.", "At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,\r\nHarry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to\r\nspeak with her for a few moments.", "'A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,' said the young man, drawing\r\nhis chair towards her.", "Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might\r\nhave been the effect of her recent illness.", "'You should, indeed,' replied Rose.", "Rose, Rose, to know that you were\r\npassing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts\r\nupon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who\r\nlinger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that\r\nyou belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and\r\nthe best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all\r\nthese consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved\r\nyou--these were distractions almost too great to bear.", "'I did not mean that,' said Rose, weeping; 'I only wish you had left\r\nhere, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to\r\npursuits well worthy of you.'", "'Rose, my own dear Rose!", "said Rose, mastering the\r\nemotions by which she was agitated.", "'It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?'", "'It is,' replied Rose, 'that you must endeavour to forget me; not as\r\nyour old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;\r\nbut, as the object of your love.", "There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with\r\none hand, gave free vent to her tears.", "'And your reasons, Rose,' he said, at length, in a low voice; 'your\r\nreasons for this decision?'", "'You have a right to know them,' rejoined Rose.", "'They do not,' replied Rose, colouring deeply.", "'Say but that, dear Rose; say\r\nbut that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!'", "'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,'\r\nrejoined Rose, 'I could have--'\r\n\r\n'Have received this declaration very differently?'", "'Do not\r\nconceal that from me, at least, Rose.'", "'I could,' said Rose.", "'Another word, Rose,' said Harry.", "'The prospect before you,' answered Rose, firmly, 'is a brilliant one.", "'One word more, Rose.", "Dearest Rose!", "'Do not press me to reply,' answered Rose.", "Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name\r\nof all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer\r\nme this one question!'", "'Then, if your lot had been differently cast,' rejoined Rose; 'if you\r\nhad been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been\r\na help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,\r\nand not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I\r\nshould have been spared this trial.", "Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded\r\ninto the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears\r\nwith them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they\r\nrelieved her.", "'I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,' said\r\nRose, extending her hand.", "'Not to press me to alter my right determination,' replied Rose, with a\r\nmelancholy smile; 'it will be useless.'", "'Then let it be so,' rejoined Rose; 'it is but one pang the more, and\r\nby that time I may be enabled to bear it better.'", "And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot\r\nwhere the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;\r\nfor, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when\r\nHarry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.", "Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed\r\ndown Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in\r\nthe same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.", "Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what\r\nsomething desperate might be.", "With that he rose, as if to depart.", "'The laudanum has taken effect at last,' murmured the girl, as she rose\r\nfrom the bedside.", "'I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,' replied Rose.", "'Sit down,' said Rose, earnestly.", "'Yes,' said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance\r\nin case she should require it.", "said Rose Maylie.", "said Rose, involuntarily falling from\r\nher strange companion.", "said Rose, in a broken voice.", "'No,' said Rose.", "'I never heard the name,' said Rose.", "I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about,\r\nyou know--'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Rose, 'I understand.'", "asked Rose.", "said Rose.", "exclaimed Rose.", "'You do not mean,' said Rose, turning very pale, 'to tell me that this\r\nwas said in earnest?'", "said Rose.", "'Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,' said Rose;\r\n'your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;\r\nyour manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your\r\nevident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you\r\nmight yet be reclaimed.", "'It is never too late,' said Rose, 'for penitence and atonement.'", "asked Rose.", "'Is it possible,' cried Rose, 'that for such a man as this, you can\r\nresign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?", "said Rose.", "said Rose.", "asked Rose.", "'I promise you solemnly,' answered Rose.", "'Stay another moment,' interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly\r\ntowards the door.", "'You will,' said Rose, after a pause, 'take some money from me, which\r\nmay enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet\r\nagain?'", "'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,' said\r\nRose, stepping gently forward.", "Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away;\r\nwhile Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which\r\nhad more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank\r\ninto a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.", "Her words and\r\nmanner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for\r\nher young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour,\r\nwas her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.", "Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but\r\nRose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's\r\nimpetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first\r\nexplosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of\r\nOliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her\r\nrepresentations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no\r\nexperienced person.", "Once the thought occurred to her of seeking\r\nassistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last\r\nparting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the\r\ntears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he\r\nmight have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.", "Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course\r\nand then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive\r\nconsideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and\r\nanxious night.", "And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the\r\nvery paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.", "asked Rose, advancing to meet him.", "'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose,\r\nsoothing him.", "asked Rose.", "With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many\r\nother incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was\r\nCraven Street, in the Strand.", "When they arrived\r\nthere, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\r\nold gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\r\nrequested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.", "said Rose, glancing from the other\r\ngentleman to the one who had spoken.", "'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said Rose, naturally\r\nembarrassed; 'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a\r\nvery dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest\r\nin hearing of him again.'", "'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose.", "'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,' said Rose,\r\ncolouring; 'and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his\r\nyears, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do\r\nhonour to many who have numbered his days six times over.'", "Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\r\nfew natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\r\nBrownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's\r\nprivate ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\r\nfor some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\r\nbenefactor and friend.", "'He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied Rose.", "After performing this\r\nevolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room\r\nat least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed\r\nher without the slightest preface.", "he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual\r\nproceeding.", "In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\nseat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\nreceived very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\nbeen the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,\r\nRose Maylie would have been well repaid.", "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\nthe way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\nof her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\nand perplexity.", "Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in\r\nher friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.", "These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\r\nreturned home.", "Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath.", "'Then,' said the doctor impetuously, 'I put it to you again, whether\r\nyou think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be\r\nconsidered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest\r\nintentions, but really--'\r\n\r\n'Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,' said Mr.\r\nBrownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak.", "Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving\r\na delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course\r\noccurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very\r\nstrongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried\r\nunanimously.", "Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\r\nmotion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\r\nMr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.", "Mr. Losberne followed, leading\r\nRose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.", "CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,\r\nBECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on\r\nher self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,\r\nby the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\r\nthis history should bestow some attention.", "As Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road\r\nwhile speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution,\r\nthe woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his\r\nside.", "CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nTHE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE.", "With which assurance he rose,\r\nlocked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her\r\nhead, flung it up to the top of an old press.", "The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull\r\nfrom the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water\r\ntoo black to reflect even their lumbering shapes.", "'You have,' replied Rose.", "Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his,\r\nand led her, with gentle force, away.", "Seeing the faint light of\r\nearly day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.", "She staggered and fell:  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down\r\nfrom a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty,\r\non her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief--Rose Maylie's\r\nown--and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as\r\nher feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her\r\nMaker.", "Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning\r\nair, that was the foulest and most cruel.", "If he ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a\r\nrelief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and\r\nborne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.", "At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat\r\nthis phantom off, though it should look him dead;

so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\r\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of\r\nthe parochial cane, rather unnecessary.", "For the rest of the day, he\r\nwas shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of\r\nbread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks\r\noutside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his\r\nmother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of\r\nNoah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.", "He is not hungry,\r\nMrs. Bedwin,' said the gentleman:  looking very wise.", "'Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the doctor.", "In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped\r\nup with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had\r\nhim carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which\r\nbelonged to her.", "Oliver _did_ see it in his mind's eye as distinctly as if he had not\r\naltered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind\r\nold lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,\r\nsatisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of\r\ntoasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a\r\npreparation.", "'I'm\r\nrather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.", "'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin.", "'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied Mrs.\r\nBedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the\r\nlast word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,\r\nthere existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.", "CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR.

and in this workhouse was born; on\r\na day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\r\nit can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\r\nthe business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\r\nprefixed to the head of this chapter.", "Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a\r\nworkhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance\r\nthat can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this\r\nparticular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could\r\nby possibility have occurred.", "What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\r\nwas!", "CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\r\n\r\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\r\ncourse of treachery and deception.", "The parish\r\nauthorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\r\nthere was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a\r\nsituation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\r\nwhich he stood in need.", "Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the\r\nfemale to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\r\nsimilar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\r\nthe very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\r\npossible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\r\nin eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\r\nand cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\r\naccident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\r\nusually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\r\nit had never known in this.", "Oliver Twist's ninth birthday\r\nfound him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\r\ndecidedly small in circumference.", "'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\r\nyear old to-day.'", "For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\r\nin full operation.", "Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\r\nslow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\r\nwild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn't\r\nbeen used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\r\ncook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\r\nbasin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\r\neat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\r\ntender age.", "A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\r\nmaster after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\r\nOliver Twist.", "Oliver Twist has asked for\r\nmore!'", "Oliver was ordered into instant confinement;\r\nand a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering\r\na reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\r\nhands of the parish.", "In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\r\noffered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,\r\nbusiness, or calling.", "As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\r\ngentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this\r\nnarrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint\r\njust yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination\r\nor no.", "CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\r\nHAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n\r\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\r\nasking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\r\nsolitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\r\nthe board.", "Having witnessed the little dispute\r\nbetween Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\r\nperson came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\r\nwas exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.", "But, as it chanced to be immediately under\r\nhis nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over\r\nhis desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\r\nsearch to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\r\nterrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\r\nand pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\r\nfuture master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\r\npalpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.", "The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\r\nagain To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would\r\ntake possession of him.", "The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took\r\ncounsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\r\nsome small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.", "Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\r\nmind, he made him his theme.", "I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\r\nwithin him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\r\nOliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.", "said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\r\nwhich she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\r\nat poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\r\ncorner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\r\nreserved for him.", "That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\r\npeople, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\r\nwith any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\r\nmany months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\r\nill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\r\nthat his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\r\nblack stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\r\nthe muffin-cap and leathers.", "One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\r\ndinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a\r\nhalf of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of\r\nthe way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,\r\nbeing hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\r\nworthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.", "And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body\r\ninto an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.\r\nBumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of\r\nOliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from\r\nwhich he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.", "'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my friend Oliver Twist.'", "Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on\r\nthe pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with\r\nwater; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole\r\nframe.", "'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'", "One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was\r\nsitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.\r\nBrownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see\r\nhim in his study, and talk to him a little while.", "'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr.\r\nBrownlow.", "'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young\r\nOliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.'", "'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of\r\nthe life and adventures of Oliver Twist?'", "It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\r\nown judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\r\nhasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\r\nbad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\r\nhis respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\r\nand strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.", "CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\nWERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\nLittle Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\r\nburnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\r\nthe summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\r\nsmall glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\r\nvelveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\r\nthat dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\r\nto recognise as Mr. William Sikes.", "Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very\r\nshort a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the\r\nbook-stall.", "CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nRELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open\r\nspace; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other\r\nindications of a cattle-market.", "'FIVE GUINEAS REWARD\r\n\r\n'Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on\r\nThursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since\r\nbeen heard of.", "Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a\r\nrather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with\r\ngreat friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious\r\nhopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that\r\nunpleasant operation.", "Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,\r\nMr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into\r\nLong Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a\r\ntumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.", "Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\r\nmatron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\r\nintroduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a\r\ncheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree\r\nof complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of\r\ncorresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most\r\ngrateful meal that matrons enjoy.", "And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have\r\nmade all necessary preparations for the old woman's funeral, let us set\r\non foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether\r\nhe be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.", "Brittles obeyed; the group,\r\npeeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more\r\nformidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and\r\nexhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their\r\ncompassion.", "With the purest\r\nand most amiable generosity on one side;

BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.", "Mr. Sikes,' said the Jew, trembling; 'don't speak so loud!'", "'Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,' said the Jew, with abject humility.", "'Perhaps I am,' replied Sikes; 'I should think you was rather out of\r\nsorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots\r\nabout, as you do when you blab and--'\r\n\r\n'Are you mad?'", "Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left\r\near, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb\r\nshow which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.", "'And mind you don't poison it,' said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the\r\ntable.", "After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes\r\ncondescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious\r\nact led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's\r\ncapture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and\r\nimprovements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable\r\nunder the circumstances.", "'That's very likely,' returned Sikes with a malicious grin.", "'Somebody must find out wot's been done at the office,' said Mr. Sikes\r\nin a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.", "'If he hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he comes\r\nout again,' said Mr. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken care on.", "This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and\r\nMr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and\r\ndeeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or\r\npretext whatever.", "said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly\r\nmanner.", "'Why, you're just the very person for it,' reasoned Mr. Sikes: 'nobody\r\nabout here knows anything of you.'", "'She'll go, Fagin,' said Sikes.", "'Yes, she will, Fagin,' said Sikes.", "And Mr. Sikes was right.", "'Give her a door-key to carry in her t'other one, Fagin,' said Sikes;\r\n'it looks real and genivine like.'", "'She's a honour to her sex,' said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and\r\nsmiting the table with his enormous fist.", "Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,\r\nthan he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,\r\nexpeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of\r\nwishing the company good-morning.", "CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\nWERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\nLittle Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\r\nburnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\r\nthe summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\r\nsmall glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\r\nvelveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\r\nthat dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\r\nto recognise as Mr. William Sikes.", "said Mr. Sikes, suddenly\r\nbreaking silence.", "Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by\r\ntheir masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common\r\nwith his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a\r\npowerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth\r\nin one of the half-boots.", "Having given in a hearty shake, he retired,\r\ngrowling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.\r\nSikes levelled at his head.", "said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and\r\ndeliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew\r\nfrom his pocket.", "The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest\r\nkey of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some\r\nunaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he\r\nwas, and growled more fiercely than before:  at the same time grasping\r\nthe end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild\r\nbeast.", "This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on\r\nhis knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.", "The dog jumped\r\nfrom right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and\r\nbarking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the\r\nstruggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the\r\ndoor suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the\r\npoker and the clasp-knife in his hands.", "Mr.\r\nSikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once\r\ntransferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.", "said Sikes,\r\nwith a fierce gesture.", "growled Sikes.", "You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a fierce\r\nsneer.", "'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as\r\nhaven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,'\r\nreplied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;\r\n'that's why.'", "'Grin away,' said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with\r\nsavage contempt; 'grin away.", "'Humph,' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on\r\nthe Jew's side than on his.", "Sikes, snatching it\r\nfrom him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it\r\ncontained.", "inquired Sikes.", "inquired Sikes, suspiciously.", "Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.", "It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie\r\nthe boot-lace which the dog had torn.", "inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that\r\nSikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.", "exclaimed Sikes.", "'Send her here,' said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor.", "inquired Sikes, proffering the\r\nglass.", "The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she\r\nsuddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.\r\nSikes, turned the conversation to other matters.", "Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,\r\nexpressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,\r\nfollowed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard\r\nas soon as his master was out of sight.", "The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;\r\nlooked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched\r\nfist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated\r\nhimself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the\r\ninteresting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.", "Sikes slackened his pace when they\r\nreached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,\r\nthe rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.", "growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.", "'Give me the other,' said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied hand.", "said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver's throat;\r\n'if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!", "said\r\nSikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.", "replied\r\nSikes.", "'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.", "'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes.", "With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency\r\nto jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step\r\nout again.", "inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.", "They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full\r\nhalf-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their\r\nlooks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.", "'All right,' cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.", "Mr. Sikes then\r\nseized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and\r\nall three were quickly inside the house.", "inquired Sikes.", "'Let's have a glim,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go breaking our necks, or\r\ntreading on the dog.", "inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\r\nseized the note.", "said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a\r\ndetermined air; 'mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back\r\nagain.'", "said Sikes.", "'Fair, or not fair,' retorted Sikes, 'hand over, I tell you!", "With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between\r\nthe Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,\r\nfolded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.", "'That's for our share of the trouble,' said Sikes; 'and not half\r\nenough, neither.", "'Of course it couldn't,' replied Sikes; 'I know'd that, directly I see\r\nhim coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm.", "Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being\r\nspoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what\r\npassed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet,\r\nand tore wildly from the room:  uttering shrieks for help, which made\r\nthe bare old house echo to the roof.", "cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from\r\nthe girl's grasp.", "said Sikes, setting his teeth.", "'The girl's gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, savagely.", "said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during\r\nwhich he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted\r\nmanner; 'you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.", "The Jew saw that it would be\r\nhopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\r\nNancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\r\nglance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\r\nhe was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.", "Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal\r\npride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy\r\nto reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and\r\nthreats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the\r\nfertility of his invention.", "said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very\r\ncommon imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:\r\nwhich, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand\r\ntimes that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a\r\ndisorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it?", "'Well, then, keep quiet,' rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was\r\naccustomed to use when addressing his dog, 'or I'll quiet you for a\r\ngood long time to come.'", "The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting\r\na hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the\r\nblood came.", "'You're a nice one,' added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a\r\ncontemptuous air, 'to take up the humane and gen--teel side!", "'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory\r\ntone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all\r\nthat passed; 'we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.'", "The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a\r\ntransport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably\r\nhave left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been\r\nseized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few\r\nineffectual struggles, and fainted.", "'She's all right now,' said Sikes, laying her down in a corner.", "The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have\r\nthe disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the\r\nboys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance\r\nincidental to business.", "That it\r\nwas possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the\r\nguilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and\r\nthat deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or\r\nover-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by\r\nthe Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,\r\nwhen he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that\r\ngentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\r\nforegone conspiracy of the kind.", "So's Sikes.", "This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities, but it\r\nwas an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only\r\nknown it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to\r\nbe out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes' dog, there\r\nexist strong and singular points of resemblance.", "'Bring in your body then,' said Sikes.", "said Sikes.", "'It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,' said\r\nMr. Sikes.", "Sikes pouring out a glass of\r\nbrandy, bade the Jew drink it off.", "inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.", "With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw\r\nthe remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony\r\nto filling it again for himself:  which he did at once.", "'There,' said Sikes, smacking his lips.", "'For business,' replied Sikes; 'so say what you've got to say.'", "inquired Sikes.", "'No, he don't,' sneered Mr. Sikes.", "said Sikes; 'I don't care.'", "But as Mr. Sikes DID care,\r\non reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew\r\ncalmer.", "'Not at all,' replied Sikes coldly.", "'No, not at all,' rejoined Sikes.", "'But I will tell you,' retorted Sikes.", "'Yes, I do mean to tell you so,' replied Sikes.", "'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes.", "'Think what\r\nwomen are, Bill,'\r\n\r\n'No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,' replied Sikes.", "'So he did,' rejoined Sikes, 'and they warn't of no more use than the\r\nother plant.'", "'So it is,' said Mr. Sikes.", "Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.", "'Fagin,' said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;\r\n'is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?'", "inquired Sikes.", "'Then,' said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain,\r\n'let it come off as soon as you like.", "'Why,' whispered Sikes, 'as you cross the lawn--'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'", "cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her\r\nhead, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's\r\nface.", "'None,' said Sikes.", "replied Sikes.", "said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, 'if I'd only got that\r\nyoung boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!", "And so they go on,' said Mr. Sikes,\r\nhis wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, 'so they go on;\r\nand, if they'd got money enough (which it's a Providence they haven't,)\r\nwe shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year\r\nor two.'", "inquired Sikes.", "Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought\r\nthe precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting\r\nMiss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.", "replied Sikes.", "Sikes looked from one to the other in some\r\nsurprise.", "inquired Sikes.", "These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both\r\ngentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and\r\nresumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.", "demanded Sikes.", "Sikes.", "'Well, he is just the size I want,' said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.", "echoed Sikes.", "said Sikes.", "'And wot,' said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, 'wot\r\nmakes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know\r\nthere are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you\r\nmight pick and choose from?'", "asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\r\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\r\nwhich he received Fagin's affectation of humanity.", "'I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,' rejoined Sikes in a\r\nsurly voice, 'if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.'", "'No,' rejoined Sikes.", "Sikes nodded.", "'And about--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, ah, it's all planned,' rejoined Sikes, interrupting him.", "It was also solemnly arranged that poor\r\nOliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\r\nunreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\r\nand further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\r\nfit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or\r\nevil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to\r\nrender the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\r\nMr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\r\ncorroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash\r\nToby Crackit.", "These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a\r\nfurious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;\r\nyelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,\r\nmingled with wild execrations.", "The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the\r\nprostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped\r\ndownstairs.", "CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nWHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\r\n\r\nWhen Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find\r\nthat a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at\r\nhis bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed.", "At first, he was\r\npleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of\r\nhis release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting\r\ndown to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and\r\nmanner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the\r\nresidence of Bill Sikes that night.", "He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,\r\nwhich would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;\r\nand after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been\r\nselected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,\r\nuntil another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.", "replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a\r\ncandle.", "This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty\r\nwelcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament.", "'Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,' observed Sikes, as he lighted them\r\nup.", "'So you've got the kid,' said Sikes when they had all reached the room:\r\nclosing the door as he spoke.", "inquired Sikes.", "'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for the\r\nsake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it.", "Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and\r\nthrew it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat\r\nhimself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.", "inquired Sikes, taking up a\r\npocket-pistol which lay on the table.", "'Well, then, look here,' continued Sikes.", "Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;\r\nand Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and\r\ndeliberation.", "'Now it's loaded,' said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.", "Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase\r\nits effect, Mr. Sikes continued.", "observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; 'women can always put\r\nthings in fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they\r\nlengthens it out.", "In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\r\ndisappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of\r\nporter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several\r\npleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular\r\ncoincidence of 'jemmies' being a can name, common to them, and also to\r\nan ingenious implement much used in his profession.", "Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\r\nappetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\r\nand water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many\r\nimprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.", "When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was\r\nthrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which\r\nhung over the back of a chair.", "growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; 'half-past five!", "Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast,\r\nhe replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite\r\nready.", "Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie\r\nround his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his\r\nshoulders.", "Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,\r\nMr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into\r\nLong Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a\r\ntumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.", "Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the\r\nthickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the\r\nnumerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.", "said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St.", "Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion's\r\nwrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast\r\nwalk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as\r\nwell as he could.", "They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park\r\ncorner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes relaxed his\r\npace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,\r\ncame up.", "'Yes; he's my boy,' replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting\r\nhis hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.", "'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes, interposing.", "Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand\r\nall the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look\r\nupon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant\r\nmanner.", "'He's sulky,' replied Sikes, giving him a shake; 'he's sulky.", "Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he\r\nmight look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his\r\njourney.", "They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;\r\nand, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade\r\nsat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their\r\ncompany.", "They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.\r\nSikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to\r\nfeel quite certain they were not going any further.", "It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes.", "inquired Sikes.", "demanded Sikes,\r\npushing the ale towards his new friend.", "'Going on to Shepperton,' replied Sikes.", "rejoined Sikes.", "The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;\r\nhaving done so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared he was a\r\nreal good fellow.", "To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he\r\nhad been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.", "Oliver and Sikes got in without\r\nany further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered\r\nfor a minute or two 'to bear him up,' and to defy the hostler and the\r\nworld to produce his equal, mounted also.", "Not a word was spoken;\r\nfor the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him\r\ninto conversation.", "Sikes alighted, took\r\nOliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.", "Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then\r\nturned suddenly down a bank upon the left.", "Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly approached the low\r\nporch, and raised the latch.", "'Don't make such a row,' said Sikes, bolting the door.", "'There's Bill Sikes in the\r\npassage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as\r\nif you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.", "'Bister Sikes!'", "you get on first,' said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.", "Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;\r\nand they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken\r\nchairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his legs much\r\nhigher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long\r\nclay pipe.", "replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the\r\nfire.", "'There--there's enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and\r\nstooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his\r\near:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with\r\na long stare of astonishment.", "'Now,' said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, 'if you'll give us something\r\nto eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or\r\nin me, at all events.", "Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool\r\nto the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing\r\nwhere he was, or what was passing around him.", "Mr. Sikes did the same.", "said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket.", "Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily\r\nswallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a\r\nviolent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and\r\neven drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.", "This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat\r\nnothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the\r\ntwo men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.", "Sikes and his companion enveloped their\r\nnecks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;\r\nBarney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he\r\nhastily crammed into the pockets.", "'I've got 'em,' replied Sikes.", "said Sikes, holding out his hand.", "Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the\r\nair, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand\r\nmechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.", "'Take his other hand, Toby,' said Sikes.", "'Slap through the town,' whispered Sikes; 'there'll be nobody in the\r\nway, to-night, to see us.'", "Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the\r\narms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass\r\non the other side.", "Sikes followed directly.", "murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol\r\nfrom his pocket; 'Get up, or I'll strew your brains upon the grass.'", "Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending\r\nOliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\r\nnoise.", "'Now listen, you young limb,' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern\r\nfrom his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; 'I'm a\r\ngoing to put you through there.", "replied Sikes, with a threatening look.", "Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed\r\nwithout noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get\r\nto work.", "This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting\r\nupon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;\r\nand, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the\r\nfloor inside.", "'Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room.", "Sikes, pointing to\r\nthe street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take\r\nnotice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he\r\nwould fall dead that instant.", "'It's done in a minute,' said Sikes, in the same low whisper.", "'Nothing,' said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.", "suddenly cried Sikes aloud.", "Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him\r\nby the collar before the smoke had cleared away.", "'Clasp your arm tighter,' said Sikes, as he drew him through the\r\nwindow.", "Sikes and the boy!", "'Sikes is not, I suppose?'", "The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which\r\nthe establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was the\r\npublic-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.", "He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes's\r\nresidence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.", "During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to\r\nassure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly\r\nreturned.", "Listen to me, who with six\r\nwords, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull's throat\r\nbetween my fingers now.", "Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his\r\ntwofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,\r\nand of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,\r\nMr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend\r\nasleep, with her head upon the table.", "muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth.", "As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate\r\nferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body\r\nof the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an\r\ninstant, to look back at his pursuers.", "For he\r\nwas not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot;\r\nand Sikes was in no mood to be played with.", "'Bear a hand with the boy,' cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his\r\nconfederate.", "cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and\r\ndrawing a pistol from his pocket.", "Sikes, again looking round,\r\ncould discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing\r\nthe gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were\r\nsome paces in advance of them.", "Sikes\r\nclenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form\r\nof Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along\r\nthe front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those\r\nbehind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before\r\nanother hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol\r\nhigh into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.", "Still,\r\nOliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left\r\nhim.", "He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who\r\nwere angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his\r\nears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some\r\nviolent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was\r\ntalking to them.", "Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the\r\nprevious day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's\r\ngrasp upon his wrist.", "'Where's--confound the fellow, what's his rascally name--Sikes; that's\r\nit.", "Where's Sikes, you thief?'", "CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY\r\nACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS\r\nTOGETHER\r\n\r\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned\r\nin the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as\r\ntherein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily\r\ngrowled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.", "The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of\r\nthose he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it\r\nwas in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great\r\ndistance from his former lodgings.", "Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's\r\nhaving gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of\r\nfurniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the\r\ndisappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,\r\nbespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated\r\ncondition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these\r\nsymptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.", "Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which\r\nformed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale\r\nand reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been\r\nconsiderable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has\r\nalready figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to\r\nMr. Sikes's question.", "'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes\r\nand limbs.", "Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised\r\nhim up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her\r\nawkwardness, and struck her.", "said Sikes.", "growled Sikes, marking the\r\ntear which trembled in her eye.", "cried Mr. Sikes.", "'Well, then,' rejoined Mr. Sikes, 'I wouldn't.", "demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice.", "At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was\r\ndelivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really\r\nweak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and\r\nfainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths\r\nwith which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his\r\nthreats.", "Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon\r\nemergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind\r\nwhich the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;\r\nMr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment\r\nwholly ineffectual, called for assistance.", "replied Sikes impatiently.", "The girl gradually recovered her\r\nsenses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon\r\nthe pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some\r\nastonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.", "exclaimed Mr. Sikes; 'I might have been done for, twenty times\r\nover, afore you'd have done anything to help me.", "'The things is well enough in their way,' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little\r\nsoothed as he glanced over the table; 'but what have you got to say for\r\nyourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,\r\nblunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this\r\nmortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!'", "'Hold your din,' cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still\r\ngrowling angrily.", "demanded Sikes.", "growled Sikes, with excessive disgust.", "I'll pound it that you han't,' replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.", "Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\nreceiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\nliquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\nassuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\nbetter temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\nbanter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\njokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\ncondescended to make.", "'It's all very well,' said Mr. Sikes; 'but I must have some blunt from\r\nyou to-night.'", "'Then you've got lots at home,' retorted Sikes; 'and I must have some\r\nfrom there.'", "'I haven't so much as\r\nwould--'\r\n\r\n'I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know\r\nyourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,' said Sikes;\r\n'but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.'", "'You won't do nothing of the kind,' rejoined Mr. Sikes.", "After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the\r\namount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four\r\nand sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would\r\nonly leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly\r\nremarking that if he couldn't get any more he must accompany him home;\r\nwith the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.", "The\r\nJew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\r\nattended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\r\non the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\r\nyoung lady's return.", "Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found\r\nrelaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and\r\nmental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat\r\nto go.", "Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite\r\nopposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened\r\nher pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.", "If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes,\r\nhe did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the\r\nmoney, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of\r\nsatisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the\r\nslumbers which her arrival had interrupted.", "That she had all the abstracted and\r\nnervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous\r\nstep, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would\r\nhave been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\r\ntaken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\r\ndiscrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than\r\nthose which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour\r\ntowards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable\r\ncondition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her\r\ndemeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had\r\nher agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been\r\nvery unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.", "As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night\r\ncame on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink\r\nhimself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire\r\nin her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.", "Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water\r\nwith his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass\r\ntowards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when\r\nthese symptoms first struck him.", "demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and\r\nshaking her roughly.", "The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed\r\nto produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look\r\nwhich had preceded them.", "'I tell you wot it is,' said Sikes; 'if you haven't caught the fever,\r\nand got it comin' on, now, there's something more than usual in the\r\nwind, and something dangerous too.", "'There ain't,' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the\r\nwords to himself; 'there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd\r\nhave cut her throat three months ago.", "Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the\r\nbottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.", "Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the\r\npillow: turning his eyes upon her face.", "She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully\r\nround, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she\r\nexpected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon\r\nher shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the\r\nrobber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with\r\nnoiseless touch, hurried from the house.", "'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had\r\nscarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes\r\nhaunted her perpetually.", "CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,\r\nBECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on\r\nher self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,\r\nby the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\r\nthis history should bestow some attention.", "She remembered that\r\nboth the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes,\r\nwhich had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she\r\nwas trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.", "Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful\r\ninducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated\r\nthat her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which\r\ncould lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a\r\nrefuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her--and\r\nwhat more could she do!", "Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.", "'An hour this side of midnight,' said Sikes, raising the blind to look\r\nout and returning to his seat.", "'You're right for once,' replied Sikes gruffly.", "That's all I know,' said Sikes.", "cried Sikes.", "'I don't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my\r\nshoulder, so take it away,' said Sikes, casting off the Jew's hand.", "'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,' returned Sikes.", "Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the\r\nsleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of\r\nthe foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving\r\nthe room.", "cried Sikes.", "retorted Sikes.", "'Then I do,' said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because\r\nhe had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.", "'Put your head out of the winder,' replied Sikes.", "'Then you won't have it,' replied Sikes.", "cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her\r\nsenses, you know, or she daren't talk to me in that way.'", "said Sikes.", "repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.", "cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the\r\narm, 'If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad.", "Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his\r\nopportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling\r\nand wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where\r\nhe sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her\r\ndown by force.", "With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make\r\nno more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at\r\nleisure and rejoined Fagin.", "asked Sikes.", "'Well, I suppose it is,' growled Sikes.", "'Nor I,' said Sikes.", "'I'll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she's\r\ntook that way again,' said Sikes.", "'She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched\r\non my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself\r\naloof,' said Sikes.", "exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of\r\nexcessive surprise on his companion.", "Whispering\r\nSikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat\r\nand bade him good-night.", "'Light him down,' said Sikes, who was filling his pipe.", "Sikes knew too\r\nmuch, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the\r\nwounds were hidden.", "But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and\r\nthat was one of the chief ends to be attained.", "If, without extracting a\r\nconfession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her\r\naltered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of\r\nwhom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,\r\ncould he not secure her compliance?", "Mortification at the overthrow of his notable\r\nscheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and\r\nutter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter\r\ndisappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of\r\ndetection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by\r\nall; these were the passionate considerations which, following close\r\nupon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain\r\nof Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his\r\nheart.", "Sitting down and throwing back his\r\nouter coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.", "cried Sikes.", "said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.", "said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and\r\nostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.", "Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face,\r\nand reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched\r\nhis coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.", "Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not\r\npreviously observed him.", "replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.", "'I don't know,' replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at\r\nthe mere suggestion.", "'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--'\r\n\r\n'I don't care who,' replied Sikes impatiently.", "Sikes leant forward in his chair:  looking on with his hands upon\r\nhis knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and\r\npreparation was to end in.", "asked Sikes, drawing back.", "'Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew,\r\npointing to Sikes as he spoke.", "'That about-- _Nancy_,' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if\r\nto prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.", "cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,\r\nand brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.", "'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to\r\nhave a dawning perception who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't\r\ncome, last Sunday, as she promised.", "cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.", "'Let me out,' said Sikes.", "Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had\r\nturned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.", "'Let it be,' said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her.", "CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT OF SIKES\r\n\r\nOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed\r\nwithin wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the\r\nworst.", "cried Sikes starting up.", "Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,\r\nbeer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or\r\nblood-stain--'\r\n\r\nThe man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew\r\nthe table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.", "Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he\r\nhad just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where\r\nto go.", "cried Sikes.", "The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped\r\nto attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and\r\nstarted back.", "Sikes made a running noose and\r\ncalled him again.", "While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their\r\neyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,\r\nand Sikes's dog bounded into the room.", "Blanched face,\r\nsunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh,\r\nshort thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.", "said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.", "'You that keep this house,' said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,\r\n'do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?'", "Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather trying to\r\nturn his head than actually doing it:  and said, 'Is--it--the body--is\r\nit buried?'", "Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy\r\nentered the room he encountered his figure.", "'Toby,' said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards\r\nhim, 'why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?'", "said Sikes, stepping forward.", "The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's\r\neyes sunk gradually to the ground.", "Sikes had him\r\ndown, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with\r\na look of alarm, and pointed to the window.", "'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching\r\nHell-babe,' cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the\r\nboy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.", "You\r\nknow that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no\r\nhope of any further gain.",

fat, more from good-humour than from\r\ngood living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an\r\nold bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any\r\nexplorer alive.", "'I

which the ladies and gentlemen\r\ngenerally were understood to express the gratification they derived\r\nfrom Mr. Giles's condescension.", "Mr. Giles looked round with a\r\npatronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved\r\nproperly, he would never desert them.", "asked Giles.", "'I am afraid you have got yourself into\r\na scrape there, Mr. Giles.'", "'I hope you don't mean to say,

anger,\r\nthat Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and\r\nexcitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.", "Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at\r\nBrittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the\r\nreply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the\r\ndoctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at\r\nthe same moment, the sound of wheels.", "'The Bow Street officers, sir,' replied Brittles, taking up a candle;\r\n'me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.'", "Blathers and Duff, attended by\r\nthe native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,\r\nwent into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at\r\nthe window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in\r\nat the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the\r\nshutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;\r\nand after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.", "This done, amidst\r\nthe breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.\r\nGiles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of\r\ntheir share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed\r\nsome six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one\r\nimportant respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the\r\nlast.", "Closely following Mr.\r\nLosberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles\r\npreceding the party, with a lighted candle.", "Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\r\nrecommended to their notice.", "'It was all done for the--for the best, sir,' answered Giles.", "replied Giles.", "replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.", "'I don't know; I really don't know,' said Giles, with a rueful\r\ncountenance.", "'I don't know what to think,' replied poor Giles.", "said Duff, addressing Mr.\r\nGiles, with supreme contempt.", "Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\r\napartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\r\nhis respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\r\nand impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\r\nanything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\r\nhis declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put\r\nbefore him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\r\nbecause Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\r\npreviously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\r\nafraid he had been a little too hasty.", "Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether\r\nMr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow\r\npistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more\r\ndestructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which\r\nmade a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had\r\ndrawn the ball about ten minutes before.", "Upon no one, however, did it\r\nmake a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after\r\nlabouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a\r\nfellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to\r\nthe utmost.", "Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the\r\nbanker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\r\nthey departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\r\nOliver with them.", "'Is is you, Giles?'", "Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,\r\nwhen he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the\r\nother corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.", "All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting\r\non the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and\r\nwiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with\r\nwhite spots.", "'I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,'\r\nsaid he.", "'I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,' said Giles:  giving a final polish to\r\nhis ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; 'but if you would leave\r\nthe postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.", "Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\r\npocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,\r\nwhich he took out of the chaise.", "This done, the postboy drove off;\r\nGiles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.", "The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious\r\nquestions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's\r\nsituation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as\r\nOliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of\r\nwhich, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened\r\nwith greedy ears.", "'Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?'", "'Nothing particular, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.", "'None at all, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.", "'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone\r\nof patronage; 'and sends his respectful duty, sir.'", "'Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.\r\nGiles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so\r\nhurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small\r\ncommission in your favour.", "Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,\r\nand was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on\r\nthe termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with\r\nsteps of unusual stateliness.", "The subject matter of this conference\r\nwas not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily\r\nenlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and\r\nhaving called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,\r\nwhich was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in\r\nconsideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that\r\nattempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of\r\nfive-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.", "At this, the two\r\nwomen-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.\r\nGiles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, 'No, no'; and that if they\r\nobserved that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank\r\nthem to tell him so.", "Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\r\nMaylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\r\nOliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.", "Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the\r\ncourse of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and\r\njust then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking\r\nhimself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to\r\npossess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting\r\nall the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.", "Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,\r\nfurnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance\r\nand dress of the strangers.", "Of these, the Jew was, at all events,\r\nsufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen\r\ndrinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any\r\nintelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.", "The post-chaise drove up to the door\r\nshortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good\r\ndoctor bustled out, to see it packed.", "The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should\r\nbe left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants\r\nwere in the garden, looking on.", "She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\r\nhad considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\r\nwriting the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\r\nstreets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\r\nbreathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\r\ncause of alarm.", "But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they\r\nsaid he did.", "As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,\r\nalthough

it\r\nwas no joke to the opposite party.", "Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is\r\ngoing upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a\r\nsurgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles\r\nround as 'the doctor,' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from\r\ngood living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an\r\nold bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any\r\nexplorer alive.", "'I beg your pardon, ma'am, interposed Mr. Giles; 'but I was going to\r\ntell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.'", "The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his\r\nmind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.", "There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,\r\nthe women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had\r\nreceived a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of\r\nthe day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.", "The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for\r\nMr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor\r\nentered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating\r\neverything, before his superior said it.", "'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.", "Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen\r\ngenerally were understood to express the gratification they derived\r\nfrom Mr. Giles's condescension.", "Mr. Giles looked round with a\r\npatronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved\r\nproperly, he would never desert them.", "'I am afraid you have got yourself into\r\na scrape there, Mr. Giles.'", "'I hope you don't mean to say, sir,' said Mr. Giles, trembling, 'that\r\nhe's going to die.", "'Mr. Giles, are\r\nyou a Protestant?'", "'Yes, sir, I hope so,' faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.", "replied Brittles, starting violently; 'I'm the\r\nsame as Mr. Giles, sir.'", "Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at\r\nBrittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the\r\nreply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the\r\ndoctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at\r\nthe same moment, the sound of wheels.", "'The Bow Street officers, sir,' replied Brittles, taking up a candle;\r\n'me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.'", "Closely following Mr.\r\nLosberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles\r\npreceding the party, with a lighted candle.", "Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\r\nrecommended to their notice.", "Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\r\napartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\r\nhis respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\r\nand impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\r\nanything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\r\nhis declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put\r\nbefore him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\r\nbecause Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\r\npreviously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\r\nafraid he had been a little too hasty.", "Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether\r\nMr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow\r\npistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more\r\ndestructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which\r\nmade a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had\r\ndrawn the ball about ten minutes before.", "Upon no one, however, did it\r\nmake a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after\r\nlabouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a\r\nfellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to\r\nthe utmost.", "All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting\r\non the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and\r\nwiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with\r\nwhite spots.", "Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\r\npocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,\r\nwhich he took out of the chaise.", "The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious\r\nquestions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's\r\nsituation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as\r\nOliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of\r\nwhich, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened\r\nwith greedy ears.", "'Nothing particular, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.", "'None at all, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.", "'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone\r\nof patronage; 'and sends his respectful duty, sir.'", "Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,\r\nand was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on\r\nthe termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with\r\nsteps of unusual stateliness.", "The subject matter of this conference\r\nwas not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily\r\nenlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and\r\nhaving called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,\r\nwhich was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in\r\nconsideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that\r\nattempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of\r\nfive-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.", "Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\r\nMaylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\r\nOliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.", "She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\r\nhad considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\r\nwriting the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\r\nstreets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\r\nbreathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\r\ncause of alarm.", "As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,\r\nalthough the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey."], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 3, 4, 4, 1, 0, 2, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 2, 4, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0,

when he was on\r\nthe point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\nfarm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\nimpatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\r\nservant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.", "Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was\r\nan old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in\r\nhis manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason\r\nto know.", "This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed\r\nnearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his\r\ncase, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility\r\nof scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable\r\na gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,\r\nMr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most\r\nsanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get\r\nthrough it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very\r\nthick coating of powder.", "'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon\r\nthe ground.", "said\r\nMr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.", "Stop--' continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever\r\nin his triumph at the discovery;

as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his\r\nentire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and\r\nOliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than\r\nhe had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence.", "He answered with some hesitation, because\r\nhe was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him.", "'If he is not,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'I'll--' and down went the stick.", "rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking\r\nthe table also.", "'We will,' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  'we will.'", "'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; 'he\r\nwill be sure to deliver them safely, you know.'", "The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out\r\non any account;

and it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile.", "It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\r\nown judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\r\nhasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\r\nbad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\r\nhis respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\r\nand strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.", "He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his\r\nfriend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.", "inquired Mr. Grimwig.", "'Of course,' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, 'I knew he was.", "said Mr. Grimwig,\r\ncaustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.", "said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.", "Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so\r\nmuch disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to\r\nvex him further.", "'You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying\r\nstory-books,' growled Mr. Grimwig.", "And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.", "This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.", "Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very\r\nstiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and\r\ndropped into it again.", "The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been\r\naffecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with\r\na great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his\r\nfeatures every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged\r\nin a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed\r\nso much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into\r\nhis former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long\r\ndeep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,\r\nbut to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.", "'I'm only sixty-one,' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face.", "'Yes, he does,' growled Mr. Grimwig.", "'He'll eat his head, if he doesn't,' growled Mr. Grimwig.", "When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,\r\nand converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,\r\ndescribed three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and\r\nthe table; sitting in it all the time.", "In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\nseat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\nreceived very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\nbeen the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,\r\nRose Maylie would have been well repaid.", "Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\r\nmotion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\r\nMr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.", "They drove straight to the\r\ndoor of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,\r\nand think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur\r\nand size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing\r\nthe young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as\r\nif he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,\r\nand not offering to eat his head--no, not once; not even when he\r\ncontradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and\r\nmaintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and\r\nthat time fast asleep.", "At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they\r\nwere to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\r\nthe room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\r\nshrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,\r\nand it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking\r\nin with Fagin at the window of his little room.", "Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great\r\nalacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her\r\nunwilling consort after him.", "'Come, sir,' said Mr. Grimwig, tartly;

and let me tell you, Mr.\r\nBumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a great\r\nhole in one's profits: especially when one has a family to provide for,\r\nsir.'", "As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\r\nill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a\r\nreflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it\r\nadvisable to change the subject.", "'By the bye,' said Mr. Bumble, 'you don't know anybody who wants a boy,\r\ndo you?", "As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his\r\ncane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words\r\n'five pounds':  which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of\r\ngigantic size.", "said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged\r\nlappel of his official coat; 'that's just the very thing I wanted to\r\nspeak to you about.", "You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this\r\nis, Mr. Bumble!", "Mr. Bumble nodded.", "'Juries,' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont\r\nwhen working into a passion: 'juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling\r\nwretches.'", "Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the\r\ninside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his\r\nrage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the\r\nundertaker, said in a calmer voice:\r\n\r\n'Well; what about the boy?'", "replied the undertaker; 'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good\r\ndeal towards the poor's rates.'", "said Mr. Bumble.", "'Well,' replied the undertaker, 'I was thinking that if I pay so much\r\ntowards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr.\r\nBumble; and so--I think I'll take the boy myself.'", "Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the\r\nbuilding.", "When little Oliver was taken before 'the gentlemen' that evening; and\r\ninformed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\r\ncoffin-maker's; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\r\ncame back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\r\ndrowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\r\nlittle emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\r\nyoung rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.", "He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having\r\nhad his luggage put into his hand--which was not very difficult to\r\ncarry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown\r\npaper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he pulled\r\nhis cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's\r\ncoat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.", "For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\r\nfor the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\r\nand, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\r\nthe skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\r\ngreat advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.", "As\r\nthey drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it\r\nexpedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for\r\ninspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\r\nbecoming air of gracious patronage.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon\r\nhim, it rolled down his cheek.", "Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble's he covered his face with\r\nboth; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and\r\nbony fingers.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little\r\ncharge a look of intense malignity.", "inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.", "Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some\r\nastonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\r\nmanner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,'\r\nbade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy.", "The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was\r\nmaking some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate\r\ndismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.", "said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in\r\nthe middle of a word; 'is that you, Bumble?'", "'Why, he _is_ rather small,' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\r\nif it were his fault that he was no bigger; 'he is small.", "Half an hour after breakfast next\r\nmorning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\r\nthe counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\r\nselected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.", "'For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,' replied Mr.\r\nBumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like\r\nhimself, was very corpulent.", "'Bayton,' said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\r\nBumble.", "Bumble shook his head, as he replied, 'Obstinate people, Mr.\r\nSowerberry; very obstinate.", "As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he\r\nstruck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\r\nindignation.", "Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\r\nfever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\r\nsight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\r\nthe mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.", "He needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance,\r\nhowever; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\r\nnow the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\r\navoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\r\nand all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\r\nshould be thus effectually and legally overcome.", "The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\r\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\r\nMr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\r\nworkhouse, who were to act as bearers.", "Mr. Bumble and\r\nSowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\r\nwere not so long as his master's, ran by the side.", "Mr. Sowerberry and\r\nBumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,\r\nand read the paper.", "At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\r\nand Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.", "Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\r\nappearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\r\nburial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\r\nsurplice to the clerk, and walked away again.", "said Bumble, tapping the man on the back.", "'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\r\nand not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!", "'Mr. Bumble!", "Mr. Bumble!'", "cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and\r\nin tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.\r\nBumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much\r\nthat he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is a very\r\ncurious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,\r\nacted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a\r\nmomentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\r\npersonal dignity.", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!'", "interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\r\nmetallic eyes.", "And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body\r\ninto an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.\r\nBumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of\r\nOliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from\r\nwhich he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.", "When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\r\nMr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\r\ndreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\r\ngentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\r\nhis lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\r\nattract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\r\naforesaid.", "The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\r\nthree paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\r\ncur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\r\nsomething which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\r\ndesignated, an involuntary process?", "'It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble, 'who\r\nhas been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.'", "'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,' said\r\nMr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.", "added Mr. Bumble.", "'And please, sir, missis wants to know\r\nwhether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\r\nhim--'cause master's out.'", "Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your\r\ncane, and see what's best to be done.", "Don't spare him, Bumble.'", "And the cocked hat and cane\r\nhaving been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr.\r\nBumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the\r\nundertaker's shop.", "The accounts of his ferocity as related by\r\nMrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.\r\nBumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\r\nin the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.", "'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,' said Mrs. Sowerberry.", "'It's not Madness, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\r\ndeep meditation.", "'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis.", "The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\r\nbestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\r\nwould eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\r\nher voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.", "said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\r\nagain; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\r\nleave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved\r\ndown; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\r\napprenticeship.", "At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\r\nknow that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\r\nkicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.", "The flood of tears, however, left him no\r\nresource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\r\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of\r\nthe parochial cane, rather unnecessary.", "Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\r\nMr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.", "London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever\r\nfind him there!", "Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\r\nthe point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\nfarm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\nimpatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\r\nservant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.", "Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked\r\nwith portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.", "Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;\r\nbut this morning it was higher than usual.", "Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and\r\nothers who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.", "Lauk,\r\nMr. Bumble, only think of its being you!", "The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of\r\ndelight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the\r\ngarden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the\r\nhouse.", "'Mrs. Mann,' said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself\r\ninto a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself\r\ngradually and slowly down into a chair; 'Mrs. Mann, ma'am, good\r\nmorning.'", "'Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,' rejoined the lady.", "'A porochial life, ma'am,' continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table\r\nwith his cane, 'is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but\r\nall public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.'", "'Lauk, Mr. Bumble!'", "And I very much question,' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,\r\n'whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong\r\nbox before they have done with me.'", "'The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,'\r\nreplied Mr. Bumble; 'and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they\r\ncome off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have\r\nonly themselves to thank.'", "There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing\r\nmanner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.\r\nMann appeared quite awed by them.", "'The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble.", "When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered\r\nthe cocked hat; and he became grave.", "Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his\r\npocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.", "Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much\r\nobliged to you, I'm sure.'", "Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey;\r\nand inquired how the children were.", "inquired Mr. Bumble.", "'He's a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble angrily.", "Having had his face put under\r\nthe pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he was led into the awful\r\npresence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.", "Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's\r\nglance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even\r\nto hear the beadle's voice.", "The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.", "inquired Mr. Bumble, with\r\nwell-timed jocularity.", "'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very\r\nmuch at Mr. Bumble's humour.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the\r\nearnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:\r\naccustomed as he was to such things.", "Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\r\nindescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\r\n'They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.", "said Mr. Bumble imperiously.", "'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the\r\ntrue state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble.", "Mr.\r\nBumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.", "At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his cocked\r\nhat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a\r\ncape to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by\r\nthe criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course\r\nof time, he arrived in London.", "He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated\r\nin the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in\r\nshivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble\r\ndeclared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel\r\nquite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.", "Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble\r\nsat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a\r\ntemperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.", "The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the\r\nfollowing advertisement.", "Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and\r\ncarefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes\r\nwas on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left\r\nthe glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.", "inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened\r\nthe door.", "Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his\r\nerrand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,\r\nhastened into the passage in a breathless state.", "The girl, who\r\nwas not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now\r\nreturned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately:\r\nwhich he did.", "Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.\r\nGrimwig's manner.", "'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.", "'No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Grimwig,\r\ncaustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.", "Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with\r\nportentous solemnity.", "Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up\r\ncountenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\r\nOliver, in as few words as possible.", "Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;\r\ninclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments'\r\nreflection, commenced his story.", "In proof of his really being the person he\r\nrepresented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had\r\nbrought to town.", "It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this\r\ninformation at an earlier period of the interview, he might have\r\nimparted a very different colouring to his little history.", "CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nWHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.\r\nBUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON\r\nSOME POINTS\r\n\r\nThe night was bitter cold.", "exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, 'is that Mr.\r\nBumble?'", "'At your service, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\r\noutside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and\r\nwho now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a\r\nbundle in the other.", "The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\r\nimpropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.", "Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold\r\nhimself, shut it without permission.", "'Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.", "When would they be, Mr. Bumble?'", "rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "'I never,' said Mr. Bumble, 'see anything like the pitch it's got to.", "'Well, Mr. Bumble?'", "'But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad\r\nthing, any way, Mr. Bumble?", "Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, 'that's the\r\ngreat principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases\r\nthat get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that\r\nsick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.", "Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to\r\ntest its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of\r\ndrawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it\r\ncarefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.", "'You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.", "'It blows, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,\r\n'enough to cut one's ears off.'", "Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat\r\nand stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.", "Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.", "Again\r\nMr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he had coughed yet.", "Mr. Bumble?'", "'Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "He fixed his eyes on\r\nMrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.\r\nBumble was that beadle at that moment.", "Mr. Bumble, having spread a\r\nhandkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the\r\nsplendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these\r\namusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had\r\nno injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather\r\nseemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.", "'You have a cat, ma'am, I see,' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,\r\nin the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; 'and kittens\r\ntoo, I declare!'", "'I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,' replied the\r\nmatron.", "'Very nice animals, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; 'so very\r\ndomestic.'", "'Mrs. Corney, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time\r\nwith his teaspoon, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten,\r\nthat could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be\r\na ass, ma'am.'", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble!'", "'It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly\r\nflourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him\r\ndoubly impressive; 'I would drown it myself, with pleasure.'", "said Mr. Bumble.", "Mr. Bumble resigned\r\nhis cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as\r\nshe took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced\r\nwaistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little\r\nmorsel farther from the fire.", "It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\r\nsitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and\r\nfronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from\r\nthe fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance\r\nbetween himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers\r\nwill doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great\r\nheroism on Mr. Bumble's part:  he being in some sort tempted by time,\r\nplace, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,\r\nwhich however well they may become the lips of the light and\r\nthoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the\r\nland, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other\r\ngreat public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\r\nstateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be\r\nthe sternest and most inflexible among them all.", "Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and no doubt they were\r\nof the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before\r\nremarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,\r\nmoving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the\r\ndistance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel\r\nround the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close\r\nto that in which the matron was seated.", "Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\r\nstopped.", "Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have\r\nbeen scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen\r\ninto Mr. Bumble's arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt\r\nforeseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,\r\nand handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.", "said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and\r\nlooking up into the matron's face; 'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.\r\nCorney?'", "What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?'", "'Mr. Bumble!'", "cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was\r\nso great, that she had quite lost her voice, 'Mr. Bumble, I shall\r\nscream!'", "Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,\r\nput his arm round the matron's waist.", "As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would\r\nhave screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was\r\nrendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no\r\nsooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine\r\nbottles, and began dusting them with great violence:  while the matron\r\nsharply demanded who was there.", "At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of\r\ninvectives against old women who couldn't even die without purposely\r\nannoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which\r\nshe hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she\r\ncame back, lest anything particular should occur.", "Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.", "Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,\r\nmade a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety\r\nthe exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats\r\nof the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;\r\nbefore he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.", "Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's\r\napproach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and\r\nvirtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his\r\ncuriousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest\r\nof drawers.", "Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was\r\napproaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded\r\nto make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:\r\nwhich, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,\r\ncarefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with\r\ndried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.", "Arriving,\r\nin course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the\r\nkey), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,\r\ngave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble\r\nreturned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old\r\nattitude, said, with a grave and determined air, 'I'll do it!'", "'Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, 'what is\r\nthis, ma'am?", "Pray answer me: I'm\r\non--on--' Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the\r\nword 'tenterhooks,' so he said 'broken bottles.'", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble!'", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble; 'who has dared to--?", "said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, 'this is them\r\nwicious paupers!'", "'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble soothingly.", "Uttering these words, the good\r\nlady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion\r\nfrom internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching\r\na pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated,\r\nfilled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.", "Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,\r\nbringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.", "Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;\r\ntook another taste; and put the cup down empty.", "'Not weak, ma'am,' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little\r\ncloser.", "By the\r\nexpiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by\r\nremoving his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it\r\nhad previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it\r\ngradually became entwined.", "'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble looking\r\nround.", "'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents.", "Mrs. Corney, with\r\ngreat propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at\r\nher pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.\r\nBumble.", "'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,' said Mr. Bumble.", "She sank into\r\nMr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a\r\npassionate kiss upon her chaste nose.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously.", "'He can't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.", "At length\r\nsummoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and\r\nsaid, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was 'a\r\nirresistible duck.'", "While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.\r\nBumble with the old woman's decease.", "'It must have been something, love,' urged Mr. Bumble.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble.", "'If I thought it was,' continued Mr. Bumble; 'if I thought as any one\r\nof 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'\r\n\r\n'They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,' responded the lady.", "said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist.", "Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed\r\nno very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble\r\naccompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched\r\nwith this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,\r\nthat he was indeed a dove.", "Assured of his qualifications,\r\nMr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of\r\nhis future promotion:  which served to occupy his mind until he reached\r\nthe shop of the undertaker.", "Mr.\r\nBumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but,\r\nattracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the\r\nglass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made\r\nbold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what\r\nwas going forward, he was not a little surprised.", "said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.", "'She's always a-doin' of\r\nit, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and\r\nmakes all manner of love!'", "cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.", "Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master\r\ncomes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that\r\nMr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast\r\nto-morrow morning.", "cried Mr. Bumble,\r\nholding up his hands.", "CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN\r\nMATRIMONIAL CASES\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on\r\nthe cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam\r\nproceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which\r\nwere sent back from its cold and shining surface.", "A paper fly-cage\r\ndangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in\r\ngloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy\r\nnet-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy\r\nshadow overspread his countenance.", "Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might\r\nbe that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own\r\npast life.", "Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a\r\npleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.", "Mr. Bumble was no\r\nlonger a beadle.", "Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.", "said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.", "Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence\r\nof happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there\r\nwas a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.", "'I sold myself,' said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,\r\n'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small\r\nquantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.", "cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: 'you would have been\r\ndear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows\r\nthat!'", "Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,\r\nwho, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his\r\ncomplaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.", "'Mrs. Bumble, ma'am!'", "said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.", "'Have the goodness to look at me,' said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes\r\nupon her.", "(If she stands such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to\r\nhimself, 'she can stand anything.", "The matter of fact, is, that the\r\nmatron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the\r\ncontrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh\r\nthereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.", "On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first\r\nincredulous, and afterwards amazed.", "inquired Mrs. Bumble.", "'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,' rejoined\r\nMr. Bumble;

and that men who ran away from their\r\nwives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be\r\nvisited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious\r\nindividuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some\r\nof the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish\r\nlinen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.", "said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.", "With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very\r\nfierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most\r\nhumiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the\r\nform of his lady wife.", "'My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, 'I didn't know you were here.'", "repeated Mrs. Bumble.", "'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work\r\nproperly, my dear,' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a\r\ncouple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of\r\nadmiration at the workhouse-master's humility.", "said Mrs. Bumble.", "'Why, my dear--' urged Mr. Bumble submissively.", "demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.", "'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' submitted Mr. Bumble;\r\n'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'", "'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,' returned his lady.", "Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two\r\nold paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated\r\nfor an instant.", "Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught\r\nup a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him\r\ninstantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly\r\nperson.", "What could Mr. Bumble do?", "said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.", "Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the\r\ngate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie);

for he was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in\r\nhis impatience, he might supply the blank.", "'I meant no harm, young man,' observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.", "'I was,' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; 'porochial beadle.'", "'Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\r\nimpressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\r\notherwise assume.", "resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's\r\neyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.", "'I suppose, a married man,' replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with\r\nhis hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident\r\nperplexity, 'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,\r\nthan a single one.", "'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to\r\nthe landlord.", "'Not too strong,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.", "The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a\r\nsteaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.\r\nBumble's eyes.", "When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the\r\ncoins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much\r\nsatisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n\r\n'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'", "'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble, not quite following\r\nthe stranger's excited description.", "'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.", "said Mr. Bumble; 'I remember him,\r\nof course.", "There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'\r\n\r\n'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the\r\nstranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\r\nof poor Oliver's vices.", "said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered\r\nfacetious.", "'That she died last winter,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\r\nopportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in\r\nthe possession of his better half.", "'Only through me,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "'To-morrow,' rejoined Bumble.", "cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble\r\ntouched him on the arm.", "CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nCONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND\r\nMR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.", "The clouds, which had\r\nbeen threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of\r\nvapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a\r\nviolent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the\r\nmain street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered\r\nlittle colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,\r\nor thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon\r\nthe river.", "They went on, in profound\r\nsilence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned\r\nhis head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,\r\ndiscovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of\r\nwalking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards\r\ntheir place of destination.", "'The place should be somewhere here,' said Bumble, consulting a scrap\r\nof paper he held in his hand.", "Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man\r\nlooking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.", "asked Mr. Bumble's good lady.", "Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.", "Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\r\napparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of\r\nproceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was\r\nprevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near\r\nwhich they stood, and beckoned them inwards.", "Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,\r\nfollowed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that\r\nremarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.", "said\r\nMonks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the\r\ndoor behind them.", "'We--we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking\r\napprehensively about him.", "That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's\r\ncaution.", "He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands\r\nsuddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.\r\nBumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.", "The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the\r\nreply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.", "'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did\r\nnot want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.", "Something that--'\r\n\r\n'You had better bid,' interrupted Mrs. Bumble.", "Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any\r\ngreater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened\r\nto this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he\r\ndirected towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised\r\nastonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,\r\nwhat sum was required for the disclosure.", "'I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble.", "'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted Mr. Bumble,\r\nin a voice tremulous with fear: '_I_ am here, my dear.", "And besides,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr. Monks is too\r\nmuch of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.", "As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern\r\nwith fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed\r\nexpression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and\r\nnot a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,\r\nindeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for\r\nthe purpose.", "'You are a fool,' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; 'and had better hold your\r\ntongue.'", "'She didn't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance\r\nunmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's\r\nviolence; 'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which\r\nwas partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the\r\nhand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'", "Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the\r\nstory was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty\r\npounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration\r\nwhich had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of\r\nthe previous dialogue.", "'--Which makes three,' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\r\nfacetiousness.", "With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an\r\niron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened\r\nclose at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several\r\npaces backward, with great precipitation.", "Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.", "'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,' replied\r\nBumble, recoiling at the thought.", "'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.", "'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\r\nhimself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.", "It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.\r\nBumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would\r\ninfallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.", "They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks\r\nstarted at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot\r\nabove the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a\r\nmarvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:  looking\r\nnervously about him for hidden trap-doors.", "Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great\r\nalacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her\r\nunwilling consort after him.", "cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\r\n'or is that little Oliver?", "Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been\r\na-grieving for you--'\r\n\r\n'Hold your tongue, fool,' murmured Mrs. Bumble.", "'Isn't natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?'", "I always loved that boy as if he'd been my--my--my own\r\ngrandfather,' said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.", "'I will do my endeavours, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.", "'I never saw him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble.", "'I hope,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as\r\nMr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: 'I hope that this\r\nunfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial\r\noffice?'", "'It was all Mrs. Bumble.", "She _would_ do it,' urged Mr. Bumble; first\r\nlooking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.", "'If the law supposes that,' said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\r\nemphatically in both hands, 'the law is a ass--a idiot.", "Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble\r\nfixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,\r\nfollowed his helpmate downstairs.", "Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually\r\nreduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in\r\nthat very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.", "Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,\r\nhe has not even

would take Oliver Twist off the\r\nhands of the parish.", "'I never was more convinced of anything in my life,' said the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill\r\nnext morning: 'I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than\r\nI am that that boy will come to be hung.'", "Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his finances\r\ncould not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;\r\nand, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately\r\ncudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse,

hat,\r\nexpeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of\r\nwishing the company good-morning.", "The dog jumped\r\nfrom right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and\r\nbarking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the\r\nstruggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the\r\ndoor suddenly opening, the dog darted out:

so slightly that the\r\naction would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third\r\nperson.", "inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that\r\nSikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.", "inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might\r\nmean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.", "Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining\r\nsilent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and\r\npresently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the\r\nbonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.", "said Fagin, looking up.", "In about ten minutes'\r\ntime, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy\r\npulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.", "Oh, Fagin,\r\nlook at him!", "Fagin, do look at him!", "'Look at his togs, Fagin!'", "Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!'", "At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,\r\nand even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound\r\nnote at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery\r\nawakened his merriment.", "'That's mine, Fagin.'", "'The boy's right,' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting\r\nhis shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.", "said Fagin, looking round.", "'No, she hasn't,' said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;\r\n'no, she hasn't, Fagin; don't think it.'", "Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs\r\nof that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel\r\ntolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any\r\nconversation with her, at present.", "'I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl.", "You will be the\r\nworse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep\r\nclear of me.'", "'I suppose he'd better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had\r\nhe?'", "Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the\r\ncleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were\r\ntwo or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with\r\nmany uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old\r\nsuit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon\r\nleaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to\r\nFagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue\r\nreceived, of his whereabout.", "'Put off the smart ones,' said Charley, 'and I'll give 'em to Fagin to\r\ntake care of.", "CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE\r\nFRIENDS\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to\r\npursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of\r\nreading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of\r\nwhich he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\r\nextent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\r\nfriends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\r\nmuch trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.", "Mr. Fagin\r\nlaid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and\r\ncherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished\r\nwith hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young\r\nlad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel\r\ncircumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing\r\na desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be\r\nhanged at the Old Bailey one morning.", "Mr. Fagin did not seek to\r\nconceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his\r\neyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young\r\nperson in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the\r\nvictim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not\r\nprecisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.\r\nFagin) and a few select friends.", "Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a\r\nrather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with\r\ngreat friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious\r\nhopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that\r\nunpleasant operation.", "So's Fagin.", "'Why don't you put yourself under\r\nFagin, Oliver?'", "'And Fagin would RATHER not!'", "'That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, 'That was all out\r\nof consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work\r\ntogether, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our\r\nlucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?'", "'Fagin will make\r\nsomething of you, though, or you'll be the first he ever had that\r\nturned out unprofitable.", "Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his\r\nown:  which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched\r\ninto a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the\r\nlife they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the\r\nbest thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin's favour without more\r\ndelay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.", "'He's in luck, then,' said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.", "After some more jokes on the same\r\nsubject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.", "After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew\r\ntheir chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\r\nsit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\r\ninterest his hearers.", "From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost\r\nconstant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with\r\nthe Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr.\r\nFagin best knew.", "Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer\r\ngarment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a\r\nchair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his\r\ntail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his\r\nnature to be.", "The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to\r\nimply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had\r\nnot met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.", "She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair,\r\nand bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a\r\ncold night, and no mistake.", "'Fagin,' said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;\r\n'is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?'", "'Nonsense,' rejoined the girl coolly, 'Go on, Fagin.", "'Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?'", "'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh.", "'I know he is,' rejoined Fagin.", "You won't see him alive again, Fagin.", "asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\r\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\r\nwhich he received Fagin's affectation of humanity.", "After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\r\ndecided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the\r\nnight had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\r\nobserving, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\nbe more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\nhis behalf, than anybody else.", "Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended\r\nhis way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode:  where the Dodger\r\nwas sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.", "inquired Fagin, parrying the question.", "The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater\r\ncuriosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\r\nvery anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\r\nFagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\r\njust then.", "He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,\r\nwhich would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;\r\nand after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been\r\nselected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,\r\nuntil another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.", "'Fagin's, eh!'", "Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending\r\nOliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\r\nnoise.", "CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat\r\nin the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the\r\ngirl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.", "'Matter, Fagin!'", "'No more of it for me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've\r\nhad enough.", "'What\r\ndo you think he's thinking of, Fagin?'", "Oh, Fagin,\r\nFagin!", "'What I mean to say, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the\r\nface, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.'", "But it turned out a\r\ngood job for you; didn't it, Fagin!", "It\r\nmust come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when\r\nyou don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?'", "Who'll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?'", "'I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her; mightn't I, Fagin?'", "'A word from me would have\r\ndone it; wouldn't it, Fagin?'", "'But I didn't blab it; did I, Fagin?'", "'Perhaps I was,' rejoined Tom, looking round; 'and if I was, what's to\r\nlaugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?'", "After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered\r\nFagin mysteriously.", "'Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!'", "'The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,' said Fagin, elevating\r\nhis eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.", "Fagin nodded in the affirmative.", "'Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?'", "Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight\r\nupstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating\r\nhimself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with\r\nhis hand, as if in search of some particular person.", "As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over\r\nthe keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a\r\nsong; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the\r\ncompany with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the\r\naccompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.", "Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face\r\nwhile these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without\r\nmeeting that of which he was in search.", "'What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?'", "inquired Fagin.", "Fagin crept softly upstairs, and\r\nentered it without any previous ceremony.", "pursued Fagin, mad with rage.", "'Don't worry me now, Fagin!'", "Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of\r\nascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but,\r\nshe answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his\r\nsearching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a\r\ntrifle in liquor, was confirmed.", "and divers\r\ncalculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a\r\nlady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable\r\nexperience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction,\r\nthat she was very far gone indeed.", "Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his\r\ntwofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,\r\nand of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,\r\nMr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend\r\nasleep, with her head upon the table.", "'Fagin!'", "Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking\r\nhome a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered\r\nsomething about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request\r\nin a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to\r\nclose it softly, while he got a light.", "'Shut the door,' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage.", "Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.", "Though nothing of the\r\nconversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and\r\nthere, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be\r\ndefending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the\r\nlatter was in a state of considerable irritation.", "Fagin!", "Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the\r\nbanker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\r\nthey departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\r\nOliver with them.", "said Fagin, looking in.", "With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's\r\nassistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who\r\nhad followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on\r\nthe floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from\r\nthe grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked\r\nit in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents\r\ndown the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to\r\nprevent mistakes.", "'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,' said Mr.\r\nDawkins; 'and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the\r\npetticuts.'", "he asked Fagin.", "In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle,\r\nwhich was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed\r\nthe articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed\r\nthem on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and\r\nexcellence.", "said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.", "said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.", "'Don't be out of temper, my dear,' urged Fagin, submissively.", "'There now, Bill,' remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.", "Who but poor ould Fagin was the means\r\nof your having such a handy girl about you?'", "Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\nreceiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\nliquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\nassuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\nbetter temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\nbanter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\njokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\ncondescended to make.", "cried Fagin, holding up is hands.", "'Well, well,' said Fagin, with a sigh, 'I'll send the Artful round\r\npresently.'", "After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the\r\namount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four\r\nand sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would\r\nonly leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly\r\nremarking that if he couldn't get any more he must accompany him home;\r\nwith the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.", "In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby\r\nCrackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,\r\nwhich it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and\r\nwith it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his\r\nyoung friends.", "asked Fagin.", "You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,\r\nto recompense me for keeping house so long.", "'Am I, Fagin?'", "'A very clever fellow, my dear,' said Fagin, patting him on the\r\nshoulder, and winking to his other pupils.", "'And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an't he, Fagin?'", "'And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an't it,\r\nFagin?'", "But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?'", "'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you\r\nthat cash, Nancy.", "The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered\r\na complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very\r\nremarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,\r\nhowever, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at\r\nthe time.", "'Only one of my young people,' said Fagin, observing that Monks drew\r\nback, on beholding a stranger.", "The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of\r\ncareless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she\r\nstole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if\r\nthere had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly\r\nhave believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.", "inquired Fagin.", "asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex\r\nthe other man by being too sanguine.", "Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did\r\nnot reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his\r\ncompanion to the second story.", "With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her\r\nhand.", "That she had all the abstracted and\r\nnervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous\r\nstep, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would\r\nhave been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\r\ntaken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\r\ndiscrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than\r\nthose which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour\r\ntowards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable\r\ncondition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her\r\ndemeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had\r\nher agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been\r\nvery unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.", "I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to\r\nold Fagin's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.'", "Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put\r\ninto your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this\r\nman--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.", "A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he\r\nshould have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a\r\nthief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.'", "They laughed, and talked of his success in\r\ndoing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,\r\nsaid that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd\r\nrather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been\r\nto have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him\r\nthrough every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital\r\nfelony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\r\nof him besides.'", "\"In\r\nshort, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\r\nI'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\"'\r\n\r\n'His brother!'", "The landlord of the house\r\nhad not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,\r\nand Barney had only just returned from making the communication above\r\nrelated, when Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into\r\nthe bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.", "Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.", "'So I mean to be a gentleman,' said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,\r\nand continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had\r\narrived too late to hear.", "The stranger was Mr. Fagin.", "'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,' said Fagin,\r\nrubbing his hands.", "'We have not so much dust as that in London,' replied Fagin, pointing\r\nfrom Noah's shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two\r\nbundles.", "Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his\r\nright forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though\r\nnot with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being\r\nlarge enough for the purpose.", "However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret\r\nthe endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and\r\nput about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly\r\nmanner.", "said Fagin.", "'Don't mind me, my dear,' said Fagin, drawing his chair closer.", "'No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,' replied Fagin,\r\nglancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two\r\nbundles.", "'In that way of business,' rejoined Fagin; 'and so are the people of\r\nthe house.", "'I'll tell you more,' said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by\r\ndint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements.", "inquired Fagin,\r\nshrugging his shoulders.", "'Quite perfect,' rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.", "said Fagin.", "'Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on\r\nmy recommendation, if he didn't run rather short of assistants just\r\nnow,' replied Fagin.", "'It couldn't possibly be done without,' replied Fagin, in a most\r\ndecided manner.", "'Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of,' retorted Fagin.", "'Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half\r\nof all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,' replied Mr.\r\nFagin.", "suggested Fagin.", "'I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my\r\ndear,' said Fagin.", "asked Fagin.", "said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah's knee.", "'The kinchins, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent\r\non errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay\r\nis just to take their money away--they've always got it ready in their\r\nhands,--then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if\r\nthere were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt\r\nitself.", "'To be sure it is,' replied Fagin; 'and you can have a few good beats\r\nchalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like\r\nthat, where they're always going errands; and you can upset as many\r\nkinchins as you want, any hour in the day.", "With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a\r\nburst of laughter both long and loud.", "asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,\r\n'What name shall I tell my good friend.'", "'Mrs. Bolter's humble servant,' said Fagin, bowing with grotesque\r\npoliteness.", "'She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,' said Mr. Morris\r\nBolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.", "'Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,' replied Fagin, telling the truth for\r\nonce.", "With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way.", "asked Mr.\r\nClaypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into\r\nbetween them, he had removed next day to Fagin's house.", "'Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied Fagin, with his most\r\ninsinuating grin.", "'Don't believe that,' said Fagin.", "'In a little community like ours, my dear,' said Fagin, who felt it\r\nnecessary to qualify this position, 'we have a general number one,\r\nwithout considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.'", "'You see,' pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, 'we\r\nare so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must\r\nbe so.", "retorted Fagin.", "'Only think,' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out\r\nhis hands; 'only consider.", "'The gallows,' continued Fagin, 'the gallows, my dear, is an ugly\r\nfinger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has\r\nstopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway.", "Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no\r\nmere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a\r\nsense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should\r\nentertain in the outset of their acquaintance.", "'It's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under\r\nheavy losses,' said Fagin.", "'No, no,' replied Fagin, 'not so bad as that.", "'What, I suppose he was--'\r\n\r\n'Wanted,' interposed Fagin.", "'No,' replied Fagin, 'not very.", "'I'm doubtful about it,' replied Fagin, with a sigh.", "Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the\r\nvulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been\r\ninformed that they represented that combination of words,\r\n'transportation for life,' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry\r\nof Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face\r\ntwisted into a look of semi-comical woe.", "'It's all up, Fagin,' said Charley, when he and his new companion had\r\nbeen made known to each other.", "'I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and\r\na hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.", "exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil.", "replied Fagin angrily; 'what are you\r\nblubbering for?'", "cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.\r\nBolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the\r\npalsy; 'see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.", "Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of\r\nCharley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to\r\nthat young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.", "'Never mind, Charley,' said Fagin soothingly; 'it'll come out, it'll be\r\nsure to come out.", "'Ay, that he shall,' replied Fagin, 'and we'll have a big-wig, Charley:\r\none that's got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his defence;\r\nand he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we'll read\r\nit all in the papers--\"Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the\r\ncourt was convulsed\"--eh, Charley, eh?'", "laughed Master Bates, 'what a lark that would be, wouldn't\r\nit, Fagin?", "cried Fagin.", "I see it all\r\nafore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.", "In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend's eccentric\r\ndisposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to\r\nconsider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now\r\nlooked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and\r\nexquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time\r\nwhen his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his abilities.", "'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,'\r\nsaid Fagin.", "'Not for the world,' replied Fagin.", "'That wouldn't quite fit,' replied Fagin shaking his head.", "'Why, if he didn't mind--' observed Fagin.", "'Really nothing, my dear,' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, 'really\r\nnothing.'", "'Wot department has he got, Fagin?'", "Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it\r\nwas some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter\r\nthat he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;\r\nthat, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had\r\nengaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to\r\nthe metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of\r\nhaving resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly\r\ndisguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in\r\nLondon, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which\r\nhe could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.", "Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much\r\ngreater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,\r\nwith a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition.", "By Fagin's\r\ndirections, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's\r\nfrock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles\r\nthe Jew had at hand.", "Thus equipped,\r\nhe was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent\r\nGarden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his\r\ncuriousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow\r\nas need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to\r\nperfection.", "The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news\r\nthat the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and\r\nestablishing for himself a glorious reputation.", "Vile as those\r\nschemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were\r\nher feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and\r\ndeeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;\r\nstill, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some\r\nrelenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp\r\nhe had so long eluded, and he should fall at last--richly as he merited\r\nsuch a fate--by her hand.", "replied Fagin.", "Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.", "'That's the way to talk, my dear,' replied Fagin, venturing to pat him\r\non the shoulder.", "laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this\r\nconcession.", "said Fagin, determined not to be offended.", "Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the\r\nsleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of\r\nthe foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving\r\nthe room.", "cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her\r\nsenses, you know, or she daren't talk to me in that way.'", "'Tell him to let me go, Fagin.", "With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make\r\nno more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at\r\nleisure and rejoined Fagin.", "'You may say that, Bill,' replied Fagin thoughtfully.", "'Worse,' said Fagin thoughtfully.", "Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.", "Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few\r\nminutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour.", "Whispering\r\nSikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat\r\nand bade him good-night.", "'The reason of all this,' replied Fagin.", "said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching\r\nher ear, and his eyes looking into hers.", "She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said\r\ngood-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look\r\nwith a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.", "Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were\r\nworking within his brain.", "He would be a valuable acquisition with\r\nsuch an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured\r\nwithout delay.", "Sikes knew too\r\nmuch, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the\r\nwounds were hidden.", "'With a little persuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what more likely than that\r\nshe would consent to poison him?", "These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he\r\nsat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his\r\nthoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of\r\nsounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.", "'How,' thought Fagin, as\r\nhe crept homeward, 'can I increase my influence with her?", "'I can,' said Fagin, almost aloud.", "CHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nNOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION\r\n\r\nThe old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for\r\nthe appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed\r\ninterminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious\r\nassault on the breakfast.", "'Bolter,' said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite\r\nMorris Bolter.", "said Fagin, cursing his dear\r\nyoung friend's greediness from the very bottom of his heart.", "'Out,' said Fagin.", "'You did well yesterday, my dear,' said Fagin.", "Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his\r\nlaugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk\r\nof bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.", "'I want you, Bolter,' said Fagin, leaning over the table, 'to do a\r\npiece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.'", "'A young one,' replied Fagin.", "One pound,' said Fagin, wishing\r\nto interest him in the scent as much as possible.", "'She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they\r\nare,' replied Fagin.", "'I knew you would be,' cried Fagin, elated by the success of his\r\nproposal.", "I'll point her out at the\r\nproper time,' said Fagin.", "That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and\r\nequipped in his carter's dress:  ready to turn out at a word from\r\nFagin.", "Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on each, Fagin\r\ncame home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was\r\nnot yet time.", "'She goes abroad to-night,' said Fagin, 'and on the right errand, I'm\r\nsure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will\r\nnot be back much before daybreak.", "It opened softly\r\non its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle.", "Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,\r\nFagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of\r\nglass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in\r\nthe adjoining room.", "Fagin nodded yes.", "'Stay there,' whispered Fagin.", "Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and\r\nthey held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place\r\nof concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.", "Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.", "'Fagin,' cried the girl, recoiling.", "'Then,' pursued the gentleman, 'this Fagin shall not be brought to\r\njustice without your consent.", "CHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn\r\nof the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets\r\nare silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and\r\nprofligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still\r\nand silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so\r\ndistorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less\r\nlike a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and\r\nworried by an evil spirit.", "Mortification at the overthrow of his notable\r\nscheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and\r\nutter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter\r\ndisappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of\r\ndetection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by\r\nall; these were the passionate considerations which, following close\r\nupon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain\r\nof Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his\r\nheart.", "Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,\r\nsat down again without speaking.", "Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the\r\nair; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the\r\nmoment gone.", "'No, no,' rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.", "'I've got that to tell you, Bill,' said Fagin, drawing his chair\r\nnearer, 'will make you worse than me.'", "cried Fagin.", "'Suppose that lad that's laying there--' Fagin began.", "'Suppose that lad,' pursued Fagin, 'was to peach--to blow upon us\r\nall--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having\r\na meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe\r\nevery mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be\r\nmost easily taken.", "cried Fagin almost in a yell.", "Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,\r\nstooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse\r\nhim.", "said Fagin, looking up with an expression\r\nof devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.", "Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him\r\ninto a sitting posture.", "'That about-- _Nancy_,' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if\r\nto prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.", "cried Fagin, half mad\r\nwith fury.", "cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,\r\nand brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.", "cried Fagin.", "cried Fagin, following him hastily.", "'Hear me speak a word,' rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.", "'I mean,' said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now\r\nuseless, 'not too violent for safety.", "Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had\r\nturned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.", "Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt\r\nfrom Fagin, get abroad to France?", "'Fagin,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'what of him?'", "There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon\r\nas hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care\r\nswagger, turned to Chitling and said,\r\n\r\n'When was Fagin took then?'", "'The sessions are on,' said Kags:  'if they get the inquest over, and\r\nBolter turns King's evidence:  as of course he will, from what he's\r\nsaid already:  they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and\r\nget the trial on on Friday, and he'll swing in six days from this, by\r\nG--!'", "'To-night's paper says that Fagin's took.", "At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they\r\nwere to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\r\nthe room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\r\nshrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his

don't think it.'", "'No, I won't do that, neither,' replied Nancy, speaking very loud.", "Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs\r\nof that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel\r\ntolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any\r\nconversation with her, at present.", "'Why, Nancy!'", "The Jew saw that it would be\r\nhopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\r\nNancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\r\nglance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\r\nhe was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.", "Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal\r\npride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy\r\nto reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and\r\nthreats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the\r\nfertility of his invention.", "So's Nancy.", "Nancy.'", "'It is cold, Nancy dear,' said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands\r\nover the fire.", "'Give him something to drink, Nancy.", "Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were\r\nmany:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were\r\nfilled with several kinds of liquids.", "'He knows what I\r\nmean, Nancy; don't he?'", "Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her\r\neyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.", "The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the\r\nfire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave\r\nthe room.", "Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought\r\nthe precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting\r\nMiss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.", "'You don't want any beer,' said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining\r\nher seat very composedly.", "Are you Nancy?'", "At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing\r\na glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst\r\ninto sundry exclamations of 'Keep the game a-going!'", "'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh.", "said Nancy.", "asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\r\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\r\nwhich he received Fagin's affectation of humanity.", "After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\r\ndecided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the\r\nnight had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\r\nobserving, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\nbe more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\nhis behalf, than anybody else.", "'Good-night, Nancy,' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.", "It was Nancy.", "'Nancy!'", "Nancy, appearing\r\nmuch gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.", "'That's right,' rejoined Nancy.", "'Yes, here he is,' replied Nancy.", "'Like a lamb,' rejoined Nancy.", "'The short and the long of what you mean,' said Nancy:  speaking very\r\nemphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his\r\nserious attention to her words:  'is, that if you're crossed by him in\r\nthis job you have on hand, you'll prevent his ever telling tales\r\nafterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance\r\nof swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way\r\nof business, every month of your life.'", "In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\r\ndisappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of\r\nporter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several\r\npleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular\r\ncoincidence of 'jemmies' being a can name, common to them, and also to\r\nan ingenious implement much used in his profession.", "Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\r\nappetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\r\nand water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many\r\nimprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.", "For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy\r\nmight seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice;

Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his\r\nshoulders.", "Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely\r\npausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same\r\npistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,\r\nand, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.", "'Nancy, dear!'", "'The boy must take his chance with the rest,' interrupted Nancy,\r\nhastily; 'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm's way,\r\nand out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.", "'Your must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,'\r\nrejoined Nancy; 'and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.", "Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a\r\nfailing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in\r\nwhich, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than\r\nchecked.", "Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which\r\nformed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale\r\nand reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been\r\nconsiderable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has\r\nalready figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to\r\nMr. Sikes's question.", "Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon\r\nemergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind\r\nwhich the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;\r\nMr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment\r\nwholly ineffectual, called for assistance.", "said Nancy, coming hastily forward.", "Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\nreceiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\nliquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\nassuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\nbetter temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\nbanter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\njokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\ncondescended to make.", "Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all\r\nsure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she's gone.'", "The\r\nJew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\r\nattended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\r\non the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\r\nyoung lady's return.", "In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their\r\nhats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,\r\nas they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in\r\nwhose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very\r\nconspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of\r\nspirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.\r\nChitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine\r\ngentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their\r\nreputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.", "'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you\r\nthat cash, Nancy.", "It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the\r\nyoung people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.", "'Don't move, Nancy.'", "Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water\r\nwith his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass\r\ntowards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when\r\nthese symptoms first struck him.", "'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered Nancy:\r\nbrushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.", "'Miss Maylie,' said Nancy.", "To him, Nancy repeated her request.", "'It's of no use saying any,' replied Nancy.", "This allusion to Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of\r\nchaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great\r\nfervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly\r\nadvocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.", "'That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,' said\r\nNancy; 'and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to\r\nsay, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned\r\nout of doors as an impostor.'", "Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,\r\nlistening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,\r\nof which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they\r\nbecame still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman\r\nwas to walk upstairs.", "Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy\r\nfollowed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber,\r\nlighted by a lamp from the ceiling.", "'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had\r\nscarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes\r\nhaunted her perpetually.", "Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\r\nfew natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\r\nBrownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's\r\nprivate ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\r\nfor some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\r\nbenefactor and friend.", "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\nthe way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\nof her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\nand perplexity.", "Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a\r\nshower of mingled threats and execrations;

and, with some hesitation, begged permission to\r\nspeak with her for a few moments.", "'I--I--ought to have left here, before,' said Harry.", "Harry still retained the other.", "'Yes, Harry.", "'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--' Harry began.", "said Harry.", "said Harry.", "Farewell, Harry!", "'Another word, Rose,' said Harry.", "cried Harry, throwing\r\nhimself before her.", "'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,' retorted Harry,\r\n'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the\r\npath before me.", "I have every reason to be happy,\r\nvery happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'", "'I ask one promise,' said Harry.", "'No,' said Harry; 'to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat\r\nit!", "said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the\r\nbreakfast-table.", "'You will tell me a different tale one of these days,' said Harry,\r\ncolouring without any perceptible reason.", "But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication\r\nfrom the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be\r\ngone?'", "'The great nobs,' replied Harry, 'under which designation, I presume,\r\nyou include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at\r\nall, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it\r\nlikely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate\r\nattendance among them.'", "Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue\r\nby one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a\r\nlittle; but he contented himself with saying, 'We shall see,' and\r\npursued the subject no farther.", "'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, 'let me speak a word with\r\nyou.'", "said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.", "'I would rather you did not mention it to them,' said Harry, hurrying\r\nover his words; 'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me\r\noftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her.", "Harry cast one slight glance at the\r\nlatticed window, and jumped into the carriage.", "And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot\r\nwhere the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;\r\nfor, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when\r\nHarry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.", "Once the thought occurred to her of seeking\r\nassistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last\r\nparting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the\r\ntears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he\r\nmight have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.", "After more communing with herself next day, she arrived\r\nat the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.", "Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\r\nmotion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\r\nMr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.", "Good to eat, Harry?'", "'Harry?", "Oliver opened it, glided away,\r\nand gave place to Harry Maylie.", "'The disclosure of to-night,'--Harry began.", "'Oh Harry, Harry,' said the young lady, bursting into tears; 'I wish I\r\ncould, and spare myself this pain.'", "said Harry, taking her hand.", "'That a sense\r\nof his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned\r\nall--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.'", "Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together),\r\ncould offer a word in extenuation.", "Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the\r\nblushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by\r\nthe doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people affirm that Harry Maylie had\r\nbeen observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the\r\nbest authorities consider this downright scandal:  he being young and a\r\nclergyman.", "Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were\r\nmarried in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of\r\nthe young clergyman's labours;

the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\r\nand his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\r\nhands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\r\nwere going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,\r\nfirst.", "The Dodger had a\r\nvicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small\r\nboys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some\r\nvery loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering\r\ndivers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and\r\nthrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that\r\nthey seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.", "These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\r\nhis intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\r\nhis thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\r\nmysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.", "They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\r\nsquare in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion\r\nof terms, 'The Green': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying\r\nhis finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the\r\ngreatest caution and circumspection.", "replied the Dodger.", "What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\r\non with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\r\nDodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from\r\nthence a handkerchief!", "The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public\r\nattention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the\r\nvery first doorway round the corner.", "He meant this to be ironical,\r\nbut it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off\r\ndown the first convenient court they came to.", "The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\r\nOliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the\r\nDodger;

and forasmuch as the\r\nfreedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the\r\nfirst and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need\r\nhardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt\r\nthem in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great\r\na degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\r\npreservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code\r\nof laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid\r\ndown as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said\r\nphilosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to\r\nmatters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment\r\nto her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight\r\nany considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.", "inquired the Dodger.", "'Hold your noise,' remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.", "inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next\r\ninterval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the\r\nquestion.", "said the Dodger.", "inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly\r\nin his merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive.", "'Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn't, and high\r\ncockolorum,' said the Dodger:  with a slight sneer on his intellectual\r\ncountenance.", "The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering\r\nthe skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue\r\ninto his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in\r\na familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down\r\nthe court.", "The door was\r\nslowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it\r\nbehind them.", "said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by\r\nthe collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.", "thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that\r\nhis keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.", "'Why, the traps have got him, and that's all about it,' said the\r\nDodger, sullenly.", "And, swinging\r\nhimself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the\r\nJew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass\r\nat the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,\r\nwould have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily\r\nreplaced.", "After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes\r\ncondescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious\r\nact led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's\r\ncapture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and\r\nimprovements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable\r\nunder the circumstances.", "This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and\r\nMr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and\r\ndeeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or\r\npretext whatever.", "replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.", "inquired the\r\nDodger.", "The\r\nreceding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,\r\nthe form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.", "Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the\r\ncleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round\r\nand round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number\r\nof low bows to the bewildered boy.", "At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,\r\nand even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound\r\nnote at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery\r\nawakened his merriment.", "CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE\r\nFRIENDS\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to\r\npursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of\r\nreading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of\r\nwhich he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\r\nextent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\r\nfriends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\r\nmuch trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.", "One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\r\nevening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\r\nevince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him\r\njustice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with\r\nthis end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in\r\nhis toilet, straightway.", "So he at once expressed his readiness; and,\r\nkneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he\r\ncould take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which\r\nMr. Dawkins designated as 'japanning his trotter-cases.'", "Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational\r\nanimal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy\r\nattitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and\r\nhaving his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of\r\nhaving taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to\r\ndisturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco\r\nthat soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer\r\nthat mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,\r\nwith a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.", "The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.", "said the Dodger\r\nmournfully.", "'I am,' repeated the Dodger.", "'He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing\r\nhimself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without\r\nwittles for a fortnight,' said the Dodger.", "pursued the Dodger.", "'Well, well,' said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they\r\nhad strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced\r\nall his proceedings.", "added the Dodger, with a grin.", "exclaimed the Dodger.", "'_I_ couldn't do it,' said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.", "'That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, 'That was all out\r\nof consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work\r\ntogether, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our\r\nlucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?'", "said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and\r\nhalfpence.", "'You've been brought up bad,' said the Dodger, surveying his boots with\r\nmuch satisfaction when Oliver had polished them.", "'And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,' said the Dodger, as the Jew\r\nwas heard unlocking the door above, 'if you don't take fogels and\r\ntickers--'\r\n\r\n'What's the good of talking in that way?'", "'If you don't take pocket-handkechers and watches,' said the Dodger,\r\nreducing his conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity, 'some\r\nother cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse,\r\nand you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha'p'orth the\r\nbetter, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a right\r\nto them as they have.'", "'It all lies in a nutshell my dear;

'he is small.", "Half an hour after breakfast next\r\nmorning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\r\nthe counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\r\nselected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.", "As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he\r\nstruck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\r\nindignation.", "Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\r\nfever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.", "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\r\nsight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\r\nthe mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.", "He needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance,\r\nhowever; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\r\nnow the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\r\navoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\r\nand all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\r\nshould be thus effectually and legally overcome.", "The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\r\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\r\nMr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\r\nworkhouse, who were to act as bearers.", "Mr. Bumble and\r\nSowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\r\nwere not so long as his master's, ran by the side.", "At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\r\nand Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.", "Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\r\nappearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\r\nburial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\r\nsurplice to the clerk, and walked away again.", "'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\r\nand not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!", "'Mr. Bumble!", "Mr. Bumble!'", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!'", "interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\r\nmetallic eyes.", "When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\r\nMr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\r\ndreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\r\ngentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\r\nhis lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\r\nattract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\r\naforesaid.", "The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\r\nthree paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\r\ncur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\r\nsomething which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\r\ndesignated, an involuntary process?", "'It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble, 'who\r\nhas been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.'", "'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,' said\r\nMr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.", "added Mr. Bumble.", "'And please, sir, missis wants to know\r\nwhether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\r\nhim--'cause master's out.'", "said Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\r\nin the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.", "'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,' said Mrs. Sowerberry.", "'It's not Madness, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\r\ndeep meditation.", "The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\r\nbestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\r\nwould eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\r\nher voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.", "said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\r\nagain; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\r\nleave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved\r\ndown; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\r\napprenticeship.", "At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\r\nknow that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\r\nkicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.", "The flood of tears, however, left him no\r\nresource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\r\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of\r\nthe parochial cane, rather unnecessary.", "Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\r\nMr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.", "London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever\r\nfind him there!", "Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\r\nthe point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\nfarm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\nimpatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\r\nservant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.", "Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked\r\nwith portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.", "Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;\r\nbut this morning it was higher than usual.", "Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and\r\nothers who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.", "Lauk,\r\nMr. Bumble, only think of its being you!", "The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of\r\ndelight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the\r\ngarden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the\r\nhouse.", "'Mrs. Mann,' said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself\r\ninto a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself\r\ngradually and slowly down into a chair; 'Mrs. Mann, ma'am, good\r\nmorning.'", "'Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,' rejoined the lady.", "'A porochial life, ma'am,' continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table\r\nwith his cane, 'is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but\r\nall public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.'", "'Lauk, Mr. Bumble!'", "And I very much question,' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,\r\n'whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong\r\nbox before they have done with me.'", "'The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,'\r\nreplied Mr. Bumble; 'and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they\r\ncome off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have\r\nonly themselves to thank.'", "There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing\r\nmanner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.\r\nMann appeared quite awed by them.", "'The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble.", "When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered\r\nthe cocked hat; and he became grave.", "Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his\r\npocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.", "Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much\r\nobliged to you, I'm sure.'", "Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey;\r\nand inquired how the children were.", "inquired Mr. Bumble.", "'He's a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble angrily.", "Having had his face put under\r\nthe pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he was led into the awful\r\npresence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.", "Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's\r\nglance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even\r\nto hear the beadle's voice.", "The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.", "inquired Mr. Bumble, with\r\nwell-timed jocularity.", "'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very\r\nmuch at Mr. Bumble's humour.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the\r\nearnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:\r\naccustomed as he was to such things.", "Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\r\nindescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\r\n'They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.", "said Mr. Bumble imperiously.", "'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the\r\ntrue state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble.", "At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his cocked\r\nhat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a\r\ncape to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by\r\nthe criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course\r\nof time, he arrived in London.", "He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated\r\nin the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in\r\nshivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble\r\ndeclared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel\r\nquite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.", "Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble\r\nsat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a\r\ntemperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.", "The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the\r\nfollowing advertisement.", "Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and\r\ncarefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes\r\nwas on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left\r\nthe glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.", "inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened\r\nthe door.", "Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his\r\nerrand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,\r\nhastened into the passage in a breathless state.", "The girl, who\r\nwas not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now\r\nreturned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately:\r\nwhich he did.", "Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.\r\nGrimwig's manner.", "'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.", "'No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Grimwig,\r\ncaustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.", "Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with\r\nportentous solemnity.", "Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up\r\ncountenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\r\nOliver, in as few words as possible.", "Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;\r\ninclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments'\r\nreflection, commenced his story.", "In proof of his really being the person he\r\nrepresented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had\r\nbrought to town.", "It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this\r\ninformation at an earlier period of the interview, he might have\r\nimparted a very different colouring to his little history.", "'At your service, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\r\noutside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and\r\nwho now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a\r\nbundle in the other.", "The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\r\nimpropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.", "Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold\r\nhimself, shut it without permission.", "'Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.", "When would they be, Mr. Bumble?'", "rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "'I never,' said Mr. Bumble, 'see anything like the pitch it's got to.", "'Well, Mr. Bumble?'", "'But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad\r\nthing, any way, Mr. Bumble?", "Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, 'that's the\r\ngreat principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases\r\nthat get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that\r\nsick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.", "Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to\r\ntest its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of\r\ndrawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it\r\ncarefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.", "'You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.", "'It blows, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,\r\n'enough to cut one's ears off.'", "Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat\r\nand stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.", "Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.", "Again\r\nMr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he had coughed yet.", "Mr. Bumble?'", "'Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "Mr. Bumble, having spread a\r\nhandkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the\r\nsplendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these\r\namusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had\r\nno injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather\r\nseemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.", "'You have a cat, ma'am, I see,' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,\r\nin the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; 'and kittens\r\ntoo, I declare!'", "'I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,' replied the\r\nmatron.", "'Very nice animals, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; 'so very\r\ndomestic.'", "'Mrs. Corney, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time\r\nwith his teaspoon, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten,\r\nthat could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be\r\na ass, ma'am.'", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble!'", "'It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly\r\nflourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him\r\ndoubly impressive; 'I would drown it myself, with pleasure.'", "said Mr. Bumble.", "Mr. Bumble resigned\r\nhis cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as\r\nshe took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced\r\nwaistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little\r\nmorsel farther from the fire.", "It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\r\nsitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and\r\nfronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from\r\nthe fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance\r\nbetween himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers\r\nwill doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great\r\nheroism on Mr. Bumble's part:  he being in some sort tempted by time,\r\nplace, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,\r\nwhich however well they may become the lips of the light and\r\nthoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the\r\nland, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other\r\ngreat public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\r\nstateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be\r\nthe sternest and most inflexible among them all.", "Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and no doubt they were\r\nof the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before\r\nremarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,\r\nmoving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the\r\ndistance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel\r\nround the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close\r\nto that in which the matron was seated.", "Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\r\nstopped.", "Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have\r\nbeen scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen\r\ninto Mr. Bumble's arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt\r\nforeseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,\r\nand handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.", "said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and\r\nlooking up into the matron's face; 'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.\r\nCorney?'", "What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?'", "'Mr. Bumble!'", "cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was\r\nso great, that she had quite lost her voice, 'Mr. Bumble, I shall\r\nscream!'", "Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,\r\nput his arm round the matron's waist.", "As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would\r\nhave screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was\r\nrendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no\r\nsooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine\r\nbottles, and began dusting them with great violence:  while the matron\r\nsharply demanded who was there.", "At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of\r\ninvectives against old women who couldn't even die without purposely\r\nannoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which\r\nshe hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she\r\ncame back, lest anything particular should occur.", "Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.", "Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,\r\nmade a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety\r\nthe exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats\r\nof the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;\r\nbefore he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.", "Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's\r\napproach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and\r\nvirtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his\r\ncuriousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest\r\nof drawers.", "Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was\r\napproaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded\r\nto make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:\r\nwhich, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,\r\ncarefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with\r\ndried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.", "Arriving,\r\nin course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the\r\nkey), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,\r\ngave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble\r\nreturned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old\r\nattitude, said, with a grave and determined air, 'I'll do it!'", "'Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, 'what is\r\nthis, ma'am?", "Pray answer me: I'm\r\non--on--' Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the\r\nword 'tenterhooks,' so he said 'broken bottles.'", "'Oh, Mr. Bumble!'", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble; 'who has dared to--?", "said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, 'this is them\r\nwicious paupers!'", "'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble soothingly.", "Uttering these words, the good\r\nlady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion\r\nfrom internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching\r\na pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated,\r\nfilled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.", "Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,\r\nbringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.", "Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;\r\ntook another taste; and put the cup down empty.", "'Not weak, ma'am,' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little\r\ncloser.", "By the\r\nexpiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by\r\nremoving his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it\r\nhad previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it\r\ngradually became entwined.", "'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble looking\r\nround.", "'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents.", "'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,' said Mr. Bumble.", "She sank into\r\nMr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a\r\npassionate kiss upon her chaste nose.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously.", "'He can't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.", "At length\r\nsummoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and\r\nsaid, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was 'a\r\nirresistible duck.'", "'It must have been something, love,' urged Mr. Bumble.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble.", "'If I thought it was,' continued Mr. Bumble; 'if I thought as any one\r\nof 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'\r\n\r\n'They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,' responded the lady.", "said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist.", "Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed\r\nno very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble\r\naccompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched\r\nwith this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,\r\nthat he was indeed a dove.", "Assured of his qualifications,\r\nMr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of\r\nhis future promotion:  which served to occupy his mind until he reached\r\nthe shop of the undertaker.", "said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.", "said Mr. Bumble.", "exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.", "'She's always a-doin' of\r\nit, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and\r\nmakes all manner of love!'", "cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.", "Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master\r\ncomes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that\r\nMr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast\r\nto-morrow morning.", "cried Mr. Bumble,\r\nholding up his hands.", "CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN\r\nMATRIMONIAL CASES\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on\r\nthe cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam\r\nproceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which\r\nwere sent back from its cold and shining surface.", "A paper fly-cage\r\ndangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in\r\ngloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy\r\nnet-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy\r\nshadow overspread his countenance.", "Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might\r\nbe that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own\r\npast life.", "Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a\r\npleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.", "Mr. Bumble was no\r\nlonger a beadle.", "Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.", "said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.", "Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence\r\nof happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there\r\nwas a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.", "'I sold myself,' said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,\r\n'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small\r\nquantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.", "cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: 'you would have been\r\ndear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows\r\nthat!'", "Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,\r\nwho, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his\r\ncomplaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.", "said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.", "'Have the goodness to look at me,' said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes\r\nupon her.", "(If she stands such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to\r\nhimself, 'she can stand anything.", "The matter of fact, is, that the\r\nmatron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the\r\ncontrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh\r\nthereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.", "On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first\r\nincredulous, and afterwards amazed.", "'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,' rejoined\r\nMr. Bumble; 'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape,\r\nsneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my\r\nprerogative.'", "'I said the word, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'To obey, ma'am,' thundered Mr. Bumble.", "Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now\r\narrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or\r\nother, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this\r\nallusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with\r\na loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a\r\nparoxysm of tears.", "But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul;\r\nhis heart was waterproof.", "'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and\r\nsoftens down the temper,' said Mr. Bumble.", "As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat\r\nfrom a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man\r\nmight, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner,\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with\r\nmuch ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.", "Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less\r\ntroublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make\r\ntrial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in\r\ndiscovering.", "Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what\r\nsomething desperate might be.", "'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker\r\nmotion towards the door.", "Mr. Bumble\r\nimmediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought\r\non his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full\r\npossession of the field.", "Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.", "After making a\r\ntour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws\r\nreally were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their\r\nwives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be\r\nvisited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious\r\nindividuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some\r\nof the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish\r\nlinen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.", "said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.", "With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very\r\nfierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most\r\nhumiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the\r\nform of his lady wife.", "'My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, 'I didn't know you were here.'", "'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work\r\nproperly, my dear,' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a\r\ncouple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of\r\nadmiration at the workhouse-master's humility.", "'Why, my dear--' urged Mr. Bumble submissively.", "'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' submitted Mr. Bumble;\r\n'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'", "'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,' returned his lady.", "Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two\r\nold paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated\r\nfor an instant.", "What could Mr. Bumble do?", "said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.", "Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the\r\ngate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and\r\nwalked, distractedly, into the street.", "Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he\r\npassed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the\r\nstreet.", "Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the\r\nstranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his gin-and-water in\r\nsilence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.", "It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall\r\ninto company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now\r\nand then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a\r\nlook at the stranger:  and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his\r\neyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment\r\nstealing a look at him.", "Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the\r\nvery remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and\r\nbright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike\r\nanything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.", "'Not that I am aware of, unless you're Mr.--'  Here Mr. Bumble stopped\r\nshort; for he was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in\r\nhis impatience, he might supply the blank.", "'I meant no harm, young man,' observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.", "'I was,' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; 'porochial beadle.'", "'Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\r\nimpressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\r\notherwise assume.", "resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's\r\neyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.", "'I suppose, a married man,' replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with\r\nhis hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident\r\nperplexity, 'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,\r\nthan a single one.", "'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to\r\nthe landlord.", "'Not too strong,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.", "When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the\r\ncoins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much\r\nsatisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n\r\n'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'", "'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble.", "said Mr. Bumble, not quite following\r\nthe stranger's excited description.", "'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.", "said Mr. Bumble; 'I remember him,\r\nof course.", "There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'\r\n\r\n'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the\r\nstranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\r\nof poor Oliver's vices.", "said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered\r\nfacetious.", "'That she died last winter,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\r\nopportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in\r\nthe possession of his better half.", "'Only through me,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.", "They went on, in profound\r\nsilence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned\r\nhis head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,\r\ndiscovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of\r\nwalking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards\r\ntheir place of destination.", "Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man\r\nlooking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.", "asked Mr. Bumble's good lady.", "Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.", "Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\r\napparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of\r\nproceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was\r\nprevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near\r\nwhich they stood, and beckoned them inwards.", "Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,\r\nfollowed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that\r\nremarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.", "That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's\r\ncaution.", "Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any\r\ngreater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened\r\nto this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he\r\ndirected towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised\r\nastonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,\r\nwhat sum was required for the disclosure.", "'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted Mr. Bumble,\r\nin a voice tremulous with fear: '_I_ am here, my dear.", "And besides,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr. Monks is too\r\nmuch of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.", "As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern\r\nwith fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed\r\nexpression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and\r\nnot a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,\r\nindeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for\r\nthe purpose.", "'She didn't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance\r\nunmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's\r\nviolence; 'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which\r\nwas partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the\r\nhand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'", "Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the\r\nstory was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty\r\npounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration\r\nwhich had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of\r\nthe previous dialogue.", "'--Which makes three,' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\r\nfacetiousness.", "With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an\r\niron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened\r\nclose at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several\r\npaces backward, with great precipitation.", "Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.", "'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.", "'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\r\nhimself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.", "They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks\r\nstarted at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot\r\nabove the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a\r\nmarvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:  looking\r\nnervously about him for hidden trap-doors.", "cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\r\n'or is that little Oliver?", "I always loved that boy as if he'd been my--my--my own\r\ngrandfather,' said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.", "'I will do my endeavours, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.", "'I never saw him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble.", "'I hope,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as\r\nMr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: 'I hope that this\r\nunfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial\r\noffice?'", "She _would_ do it,' urged Mr. Bumble; first\r\nlooking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.", "'If the law supposes that,' said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\r\nemphatically in both hands, 'the law is a ass--a idiot.", "Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble\r\nfixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,\r\nfollowed his helpmate downstairs.", "Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,\r\nhe has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his\r\nwife."], [4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4,

and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,\r\nsaid that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd\r\nrather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been\r\nto have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him\r\nthrough every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital\r\nfelony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\r\nof him besides.'", "I know many who do worse things;

and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\r\nOliver, in as few words as possible.", "Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow's\r\nobservations.", "Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so\r\nmuch disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to\r\nvex him further.", "'Mrs. Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; 'that\r\nboy, Oliver, is an imposter.'", "As it extorted\r\nnothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head,\r\nand smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was\r\nstopped by Mr. Brownlow.", "There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night.", "As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,\r\nthey were enabled to drive straight thither.", "'What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the\r\nadjoining house, do you know?'", "She presently\r\nreturned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone\r\nto the West Indies, six weeks before.", "'The old gentleman, the housekeeper,\r\nand a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow's, all went together.'", "This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in\r\nthe midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times\r\nduring his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.\r\nBedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how\r\nmany long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had\r\ndone for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them.", "'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to\r\narticulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we\r\nhave so often talked about.'", "When they arrived\r\nthere, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\r\nold gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\r\nrequested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.", "'Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?'", "Mr. Brownlow inclined his head.", "said Mr. Brownlow.", "'Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'he does not\r\nmean what he says.'", "'No, he does not,' said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he\r\nspoke.", "'Now, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to return to the subject in\r\nwhich your humanity is so much interested.", "In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\nseat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\nreceived very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\nbeen the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,\r\nRose Maylie would have been well repaid.", "'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said\r\nMr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.", "'Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, rather\r\ntestily.", "'I could have told you that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but put on your\r\nglasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will\r\nyou?'", "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\nthe way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\nof her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\nand perplexity.", "And, doubtless, he would, in this first\r\noutbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's\r\nconsideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in\r\npart, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was\r\nhimself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and\r\nrepresentations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his\r\nhotbrained purpose.", "'Not exactly that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; 'but we must\r\nproceed gently and with great care.'", "'I'd send them one and\r\nall to--'\r\n\r\n'Never mind where,' interposed Mr. Brownlow.", "'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; 'placing this poor girl entirely out\r\nof the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these\r\nscoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should\r\nwe bring about?'", "'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will\r\nbring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step\r\nin to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very\r\nQuixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to\r\nOliver's, which is the same thing.'", "Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving\r\na delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course\r\noccurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very\r\nstrongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried\r\nunanimously.", "'We must put it to the vote,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'who may he be?'", "rejoined Mr. Brownlow.", "'No, my love,' replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back.", "CHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nMONKS AND MR.

'it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy\r\nyears were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and\r\nkindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary,\r\nlonely man:  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters'\r\ndeath-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven\r\nwilled otherwise--have made her my young wife; it is because my seared\r\nheart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and\r\nerrors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations\r\nfilled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts\r\nof him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you\r\ngently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your\r\nunworthiness who bear the name.'", "'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'nothing to you.", "'This is all mighty fine,' said Monks (to retain his assumed\r\ndesignation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself\r\nin sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his\r\nface with his hand.", "'You have a brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  'a brother,\r\nthe whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the\r\nstreet, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,\r\nin wonder and alarm.'", "'Attend to what I do know, and you may not,' said Mr. Brownlow.", "'When they had been separated for some time,' returned Mr. Brownlow,\r\n'and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had\r\nutterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who,\r\nwith prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new\r\nfriends.", "'These new friends, then,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'were a naval officer\r\nretired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year\r\nbefore, and left him with two children--there had been more, but, of\r\nall their family, happily but two survived.", "'They resided,' said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the\r\ninterruption, 'in a part of the country to which your father in his\r\nwandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.", "'It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,' returned\r\nMr. Brownlow, 'and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed\r\njoy and happiness, it would be very brief.", "As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the\r\nair of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face\r\nand hands.", "'Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,'\r\nsaid Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other's face,\r\n'he came to me.'", "'I went,' said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, 'I went, when all was\r\nover, to the scene of his--I will use the term the world would freely\r\nuse, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him--of his\r\nguilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child\r\nshould find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.", "'When your brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other's\r\nchair, 'When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was\r\ncast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a\r\nlife of vice and infamy--'\r\n\r\n'What?'", "'By me,' said Mr. Brownlow.", "'Denial to me is vain,' replied Mr. Brownlow.", "'I _did not_,' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; 'but within the last\r\nfortnight I have learnt it all.", "'It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,' replied Mr. Brownlow.", "'You must do more than that,' said Mr. Brownlow.", "asked Mr. Brownlow.", "'I will give fifty more,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and proclaim it with my\r\nown lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.", "'Fagin,' said Mr. Brownlow;
