CHARACTER EXTRACTION
====================

The purpose of this program is to extract the names of fictional characters from a novel and analyze the sentences the characters appear in or are referenced in within the text in order to build a profile containing data specific to each character. It was created using the 32-bit version of Python 2.7 with the Natural Language Toolkit and Pattern libraries. 

To change the book to be analyzed, add the book as a text file to the same file directory as the program, change the name of the text file on line 27 of the file and rerun the program. You can also have the book file in a different directory and reference the file path to the book instead.

Pattern is a web mining module for Python. It has tools for data mining 
(web services for Google, Twitter and Wikipedia, web crawler, HTML DOM parser), 
natural language processing (part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment 
analysis, WordNet), machine learning (vector space model, clustering, 
classification using KNN, SVM, Perceptron) and network analysis (graph 
centrality and visualization). It is well documented and bundled with 50+ 
examples and 350+ unit tests. The source code is licensed under BSD and 
available from http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern.
